1   Introduction
In May 1839, Lin Zexu, imperial commissioner of the Qing dynasty (1644–1911), public-ly destroyed a generous quantity of opium seized from British smugglers in Canton, as part of an aggressive campaign to root out the empire’s rampant drug problem. Though Lin had every reason and right to do so, his actions would cause more trouble than they solved. In September, a British Cabinet meeting decided, in retaliation, to mount an expe-dition against China—commercial interests were at stake, so never mind the morality of it. The following spring, the matter was becoming one of national prestige: in the wake of grandiloquent speeches about protecting “the dignity of the British Crown,” a motion for war was pushed through the Parliament by a narrow vote. Not long after, the British fleet reached Chinese waters and, without further ado, began pouring broadsides up and down the coast. In battle after battle, the Qing forces, despite their vast numerical superiority, crumbled before the hail of British cannon fire.1 After the British had advanced menacing-ly far up the Yangtze river, emperor Daoguang admitted defeat, and sued for peace. The Qing plenipotentiaries rushed through the ensuing negotiations—concerned only with getting the British to withdraw, they were willing to sign whatever ‘scrap paper’ would do the trick. On August 29, 1842, the two sides concluded the Treaty of Nanjing, the terms of which were in every respect disadvantageous to the Qing government. Apparently the Chi-nese, yet uninitiated in diplomacy, did not at all understand what they were signing away.2
	A minor war over a commercial dispute, provoked and waged in violation of interna-tional law, ending in a treaty that disproportionately benefits the victor—unremarkable though they may be, these events have come to occupy a pivotal place in the Chinese his-torical imagination, with repercussions that are felt to this day. The Qing dynasty’s defeat by Britain is regarded in China as the inauguration of the nation’s modern history (1840–1949), during which the once-great empire was violently hauled out of self-isolation and reduced to a political nonentity, as imperialist powers took turns carving out their share in the spoils. This hundred-year period is conventionally understood in China as an abject history of victimization by the West—a singularly dismal passage set off sharply from the nation’s premodern grandeur and present-day prosperity. It is rather telling that the Chi-nese have retrospectively come to call it the ‘Century of national humiliation’ (henceforth the ‘Century’).3
	Bleak as it is, the memory of the ‘Century’ remains raw and alive. Though decades have since passed, many Chinese today are acutely aware of, and (judging from the inces-sant teeth-gnashing on the internet) deeply upset by the horrors to which their forebears were subjected by foreign powers during that time. School textbooks, media, and films tell and retell the story of this shameful interval, while museums, monuments, and tourist des-tinations across the country mark and commemorate key sites and events. Whether in the classroom or in the museum, young Chinese are urged to ‘never forget’ or, better still, to ‘wipe away national humiliation.’ Thus the ‘Century,’ tightly anchored to the forefront of public consciousness, has become a past that is not quite ‘past.’ There is a pervasive sense that it continues to speak directly to the present—and nowhere more so than in China’s relations with the outside world. Foreign criticism is routinely met with angry references to the invasions, massacres, and other miseries once inflicted on the nation by the West; conflicts and disputes with foreign countries are understood not only in the present tense, but readily interpreted as the latest in a long line of insults. Remarkably, for all its domestic fault-lines and schisms, here China seems to speak with one voice: most Chinese, whether inside or outside the government, whether urban or rural, northern or southern, would agree that China’s modern past is a history of humiliation at the hands of foreign imperial-ists—and that this bitter lesson remains as relevant as ever.4
	But none of this is exactly new. That the ‘Century’ continues to cast a long shadow over the present is well known to China watchers, and should be no less clear to anyone with close personal or professional ties to the country. International relations scholars, in particular, have paid serious attention to how the past frames the ways in which China interacts with the world, most notably as concerns the checkered Sino–Japanese relations (which are quite impossible to understand apart from the ‘history issue’). In his classic 1989 study, Allen Whiting demonstrates how Chinese perceptions of—and, by extension, policy toward—Japan remain hostage to memories of wartime aggression. There is little hope of developing a working relationship, he finds, because the Chinese are emotionally overinvested in a visceral image of their neighbor as “a ruthless aggressor whose rape and plunder of China must not be forgotten.”5 It should be safe to say that Whiting’s pessi-mism was not unwarranted: twenty-plus years later, his argument is still disturbingly perti-nent. A more recent account by He Yinan, published in 2009, points at the very same cul-prit: it is the past, more than anything, that continues to bedevil attempts at rapprochement between the two nations. If only, goes the conclusion, these old enemies would stop per-petuating their “pernicious historical myths,” and put the past behind them, then nothing would stand in the way of a thriving Sino–Japanese symbiosis.6
	But is the ‘Century’ really just ‘baggage of history’—something that could be settled with heartfelt apologies and new history textbooks? Arguably, there is more at stake. While these analyses do capture well the outward expression, they often overlook the in-ner dynamics. The Chinese preoccupation with ‘never forgetting’ is not only about identi-fying enemies, but also, perhaps even more importantly, about identifying the self. Public remembrance of the ‘Century,’ besides reminding the Chinese of old grievances and unset-tled scores with foreigners, also binds them together as a nation through a shared legacy of suffering and victimhood.7 This side of the coin remains woefully understudied.
	It could thus be said that the ‘Century’ is well known, but not that well understood (outside of China, that is). What does ‘national humiliation’ even mean, and how did the Chinese come to remember their modern past in such terms? One early contributor to ad-dress this gap is historian Paul Cohen who, in a seminal article from 2002, traces the emer-gence of the humiliation discourse in the early twentieth century.8 What he finds is a popu-lar call to arms that swept like a ripple through urban China, rallying people around the idea that the foreign encroachment (still ongoing at that time) was a collective embarrass-ment. If the people felt ashamed by their country’s plight, went the logic, perhaps they would do something about it. Sure enough, a surge of anti-foreign activities followed, from rallies and boycotts to rioting. However, this sentiment was fundamentally inward-looking: it called on the Chinese to identify in themselves the ‘sickness’ that facilitated for-eign incursion—namely, apathy and forgetfulness (hence the need to ‘never forget’). To-ward the end of the article, Cohen also notes in passing the sudden reemergence of the hu-miliation discourse in the 1990s. As if picking up from here, Peter Hays Gries, in his 2004 monograph, makes the same observation and fills in some details. During the 1990s, Gries reports, there was a gradual shift in Chinese historical writing from the heroic narratives of the Mao period toward dark and depressing narratives about the ‘Century.’ National humil-iation was back on the agenda. This “reencounter with past trauma,” he further argues, has come to shape not only the Chinese perception of the world, but even more so—and this is a key point—of themselves.9 While Cohen and Gries, and a few others,10 have done much to advance our still tenuous understanding of the subject, it has been treated most compre-hensively and critically by William Callahan. In a series of articles beginning in 2004 and culminating in his excellent 2010 monograph, Callahan carefully anatomizes the various dialectical tensions (between past and present, state and society, domestic and foreign, et cetera) on which Chinese identity politics are structured, and shows just how decisively the ‘Century’ factors into that equation.11 His penetrating analysis makes it perfectly clear that the ‘Century’ is not ‘just history’ confined to the pages of textbooks. Besides a lens through which China views and engages the world, it is also a mirror in which China reflects itself. It is a national aesthetic that has resonated down the years, and a discursive continuity that links Chinese today to the nation’s founding moments.
	However, there is an unfortunate oversight in this pioneering literature: that is, the ‘Century’ in and of itself. What exactly does it tell? What kind of a history is it? This is not to suggest that Callahan and the others do not look into these questions. They do, but only in passing while pursuing some ‘bigger’ question, such as ramifications for foreign policy or identity formation. As a result, reading through these studies, we see the footprints of the ‘Century,’ so to speak, but do not get a good look at the creature that left those prints. Of course, if one needs to see the ‘Century’ for themselves, there is always the enormous body of writing in Chinese, readily available for anyone’s perusal. But these writings often present the ‘Century’ at face value, as if it were the whole truth, offering the reader little in the way of critical reflection and understanding. And what of those who do not have a sufficient command of the Chinese language—where can they read about the ‘Century’?
	This is the lacuna which the present study attempts to address: to familiarize the non-Chinese reader with the ‘Century’ in more detail than afforded by the existing anglophone literature, while also incorporating the critical voice which is missing from the literature in Chinese. Put another way, this thesis is an introduction to the reading of China’s modern past as a ‘Century of national humiliation,’ with two overarching aims: on the one hand, to describe the ‘Century’—how does it make sense of the past? On the other, to interrogate the ‘Century’—how faithfully does it record the past it claims to represent?
	For these purposes, the secondary literature does not take us far. (Remember, the idea is precisely to fill a gap in that literature.) The only option, then, is to look at what may here be considered as ‘primary’ sources: that is, literature in Chinese. I have pored over some ninety articles on the ‘Century’ published in Chinese academic journals and other periodicals between 1990 and 2014. These articles were randomly retrieved from the Chi-na Academic Journals (CAJ) and Century Journals Project (CJP) databases,12 by search-ing with relevant keywords such as guochi (‘national humiliation’), bainian guochi (‘Cen-tury of national humiliation’), wuwang guochi (‘never forget national humiliation’). The searches were not limited by publication date; rather, the time frame, 1990–2014, reflects the fact that the overwhelming majority of the ‘Century’ writings date from after 1990 (the reasons for this will become apparent later). The better part of these articles come from journals published by universities, colleges, or their affiliated research institutes, mostly in the field of humanities and social sciences. Journals in education are particularly overrep-resented, accounting roughly for a fifth of the whole. It should be noted that there is also a number of articles from non-academic periodicals with nationalistic overtones and/or close ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), such as Guofang and Zhonghuahun. But these ‘anomalies’ are likewise authored by historians and academics, and do not differ in any significant way from those published in scholarly journals; there is thus no need to consider the two separately. All in all, though limited in scope, this random collection of articles reveals a great deal about the basics of the ‘Century,’ just so that we may accurate-ly trace its contours. Much of what will be discussed in the coming pages is heavily in-formed by this sample of texts, henceforth simply referred to as ‘writings.’13
	As is clear from the table of contents, I have taken some liberties with structure. Rather than follow the established hypothesis–analysis–discussion format, this thesis is organized into three independent chapters, each of which approaches the ‘Century’ from a slightly different angle—of course, all with the common goals of description and analysis. The first chapter examines the historical memory of the ‘Century,’ loosely appropriating social constructivist ideas of how communities continually remold the past in the image of the present. The aim is to understand how the ‘Century’ is remembered and forgotten, and to find out whether there is a pattern to the inclusion/exclusion of past events. This is done by extracting an orthodox reading from the ‘writings,’ which is then compared with rele-vant secondary literature, to check for inconsistencies and blind spots. The second chapter expands on this reading by shifting the focus from the question of memory to that of narra-tive: that is, how does the ‘Century’ explain the past that it remembers. The aim is to figure out, following Paul Cohen’s lead,14 whether the ‘Century’ is better understood as history or as ‘myth’—whether it reads from or into the past. Or, put more plainly, whether it deepens or cheapens our understanding of what actually happened. The third chapter differs from the other two in that it examines the ‘Century’ not in isolation of the world, but places it in the sociopolitical context of contemporary China. The purpose is to account for the 1990s reemergence of the ‘Century’: both the developments that led up to it, as well as the im-pact it has had on the ‘Century’ itself. As the chapter title suggests, this last part may be useful to those with an interest in the political uses and misuses of history. Finally, if only for the sake of convention, there is a brief conclusion that recaps the main points. By the end of this thesis, the reader should have a good idea of the content and characteristics of the ‘Century of national humiliation,’ the ways in which it makes concessions to today’s demands, and the reasons why this particular reading of the past remains so present in the Chinese consciousness.
2   Memory
Most Chinese remember their nation’s modern history as a ‘Century of national humilia-tion.’ Notice the word ‘remember’—it is vital to understand right from the start that, in the case of the ‘Century,’ we are not dealing with historical reality, but with historical memory. The point here is that social groups, such as nations, collectively remember their past in ways that closely resemble individual memory: rather than the objective past as it was, collective memory holds an impression of that past, shaped over time by the dynamics of remembering and forgetting. Some aspects are magnified, others trivialized. Some events fall into oblivion by chance, others are blotted out on purpose. Thus, whereas the objective past is static and singular, remembered pasts change in step with the changing needs and preferences of the present. Simply put, in historical memory, the present weighs on the past as much as the past weighs on the present. This is why memory ultimately departs from the past it claims to record—historical memory, ironically, tends to move toward the ahistorical.15
	So, when we look at the ‘Century,’ we are not looking directly at the real past, but rather at its reflection in the Chinese historical consciousness. This is not to say, however, that it is necessarily fictitious: the real and remembered pasts obviously may, and often do overlap. The point, rather, is that the ‘Century’ should be approached with reservation: chances are high that it, to some extent and in some respects, deviates from historical reali-ty. The better part of this whole thesis, in fact, has to do with figuring out where the mem-ory is truthful, and where it has taken on a life of its own. On the one hand, we will try to describe the ‘Century’ as conventionally told in Chinese writings, so as to gain an insider’s view of modern Chinese history; on the other, we will try to identify if, where, and how that view is at odds with the factual past.16 If these analytical considerations at this point still appear conjectural, their pertinence will become clear soon enough, once we sink our teeth into the very vivid and tangible discrepancies between fact and fancy.
	This first chapter starts from the ground up, and attempts to address the very basic question of coverage. Which parts of the past does the ‘Century’ recount, and how? And, conversely, which parts does it leave out, and why? Or, in terms of memory, what is ‘re-membered,’ and what ‘forgotten’? Accordingly, this chapter splits into two sections. First, we will reproduce, rather uncritically, the story of China’s modern past as seen through Chinese eyes. Second, we will collate that story with a more historical understanding of the same period, to see whether anything crucial is missing or out of place.
2.1   Remembering
How exactly is the ‘Century’ remembered? To get a sense of this, we had best turn to our so-called primary sources: that is, the medley of Chinese-language articles introduced earlier as ‘writings.’ With just a cursory review, it becomes quite obvious that these texts, despite appearing in a variety of outlets over a wide swath of time, show a startling unifor-mity in content, structure, and style. Each account describes more or less the same set of events, from the same perspective, with the same vocabulary. Even the untrained eye read-ily detects a dominant narrative arc that is faithfully reproduced from one article to the other. There, no doubt, is a uniform and normative understanding of modern Chinese history, to which these writings unanimously subscribe. If we were to isolate that under-standing, we arguably would get very close to the memory of the ‘Century.’ In this section, we will try to do just that by paring the writings down to their essentials, and piecing together the bits that recur most frequently, thereby forming something of a prototypical account of the ‘Century’—which, then, will be taken as an answer to the question of remembering. In practice this means that we will go through, in chronological order, the events that figure most prominently in the writings, all the while imitating the style in which they are typically recounted.
	But first, a caveat. The following, for the most part, is written in a straightforward fashion, with copious quotes from the writings, yet very few phrases indicating a critical distance therefrom. On the face of it, one might get the impression that I am treating these texts as an objective account of the events in question. This, I must stress, is not the case. My purpose here, rather, is to showcase what an orthodox account of the ‘Century’ might look like. If only for the sake of readability, I have cut critical remarks and comments down to a minimum (a more analytical treatment follows in the second section). This being said, there hopefully will be no misunderstanding as to where I stand in relation to the authors’ views.
2.1.1   Opium Wars
The ‘Century’ opens in 1840 with the roar of British cannon battering the coastline of an unsuspecting and ill-prepared China. The British, long itching to “dig their talons into the vast and abundant Chinese lands,” had been making inroads by “dumping opium” into the country since the turn of the century.17 The Qing court’s clampdown on the illicit opium trade, resulting in the confiscation and burning of some 20,000 chests of the stuff, had finally provided Britain with a convenient pretext for open conflict.18 Thus began the First Opium War (1840–42), unjustly forced upon China by “mercerany British bourgeoisie.”19 If, at the outset of the war, the Qing rulers still entertained any delusions of grandeur, such delusions were all but shattered as Britain’s “sturdy ships and powerful guns” pulverized the antiquated Qing armies, downright “medieval” in comparison.20 China’s crushing defeat was cemented in the Treaty of Nanjing (1842), whereby the Qing government buckled to all the Brits’ demands—opening a number of ports for foreign trade, paying large indemnities and, worst of all, ceding Hong Kong—yet received nothing in return. This agreement, as the first of the many ‘unequal treaties’21 that were “imposed” on China over the years to come, “set the precedent for the frantic pillaging and enslavement of the Chinese people by way of treaties,” that would be followed by other imperialist powers “swarming in” after the British.22 Little did the Qing officials know, upon affixing their signatures, that they set in motion a cascade of events that would bring the age-old empire toppling down and leave her holdings to be parcelled out among petty warlords and foreign marauders. “Having seen Britain cut a slice of fatty meat off China,” as one author picturesquely explains, “all the other Western powers went green with envy, and pounced on China like hungry tigers and wolves on a baby lamb.”23 From then on “the Chinese race,” another bewails, “descended into an endless night of anarchy and depredation.”24
	Indeed, the First Opium War was but a taste of what was to come. At the time, compe-tition for empire was heating up, and the long-isolated China had only just been pried open. With the cession of Hong Kong, Britain had secured a foothold on Chinese soil; yet this generous concession, one author deplores, “instead of satisfying the British aggres-sors’ appetite, only further fueled their avarice.”25 “A conqueror’s greed,” echoes another, “knows no bounds.”26 Thus, after a strained 14-year hiatus, the British, now in league with the French, resumed hostilities against Qing China. The Second Opium War (1856–60) was no less devastating and humiliating than the first, forcing the Qing government, once again, to sign away the nation’s rights. The concluding Beijing Convention (1860), in addition to the routine reparations and compensations, granted all manner of further privi-leges to foreigners, such as the right for missionaries to travel and preach freely throughout the country, thereby paving the way for the West’s “spiritual and cultural infiltration.”27 This treaty, we are told, even “legalized human trafficking,” allowing “foreign slave trad-ers to brazenly go about their dirty business in China,” shipping off coolies “by the mil-lions,” many of whom would either be “tortured to death en route,” or “die a slave in alien lands.”28 Worse still, the Kowloon peninsula, immediately to the north of Hong Kong is-land, was surrendered to the British. With this defeat, a formulaic complaint goes, China was plunged even deeper into the mire of “semi-colonialism,” another step closer to being “gobbled up” by Western powers.29
2.1.2   Yuanmingyuan
Yet the crowning disgrace of the Opium Wars took place neither on the battlefield, nor at the negotiating table but, literally, on the emperor’s backyard. For all the military routs and diplomatic fumbling, no other event is recounted as bitterly as the destruction of Yuan-mingyuan, the emperor’s summer retreat, in the closing days of the latter war. There are long, woeful descriptions of how the Anglo–French force, having seized the capital, first “thoroughly ransacked” the “Garden of All Gardens,” and then “put it to the torch,”30 re-ducing 150 years of architectural brilliance to ashes in what constitutes “an unheard of ca-lamity in the history of human civilization.”31 The “innumerable cultural treasures” housed within the complex, “many of them one of a kind, their value beyond reckoning,” fell into the hands of British and French soldiers who, “like raging wild beasts, stole whatever they could and smashed up the rest.”32 Then, as if looting the place clean was not enough, the thieves set the precincts afire, such that “for three days on end, a great blaze blotted out the sky and sun, as all the palaces, temples, and other ancient structures were incinerated en-tirely.”33 “Amid the roaring flames,” one author thunders, “Yuanmingyuan—an accumula-tion of the genius and fortunes of the Chinese people, and the greatest of all gardens in the world—was plundered and burned to the ground by a pack of British and French imperial-ist gangsters—reputedly the world’s most civilized and advanced people.”34
	The juxtaposition in this last quote is revealing: the symbolic epicenter of Chinese civilization, an apex of ingenuity and beauty, was desecrated at the hands of Westerners, who so eagerly wrap themselves in a veneer of superiority. Similar remarks abound throughout the writings. Clearly, this incident is privileged only insofar as it attests to the foreigners’ barbarity and disrespect for China. Never mind that Yuanmingyuan was strictly off limits to everyone but the emperor and his entourage—its scorched remains speak not of feudal extravagance, but of “the powers’ ruthless despoliation of China.”35 Never mind, either, that ordinary Chinese never so much as caught a glimpse of the “Garden of All Gardens”—its destruction by foreigners, nonetheless, was “an unforgivable sin against the Chinese people,” one that will remain “forever nailed to the pillory of history.”36 With this sacrilegious act, the British and French left behind a “lasting monument to national humili-ation” that “for all eternity, in silence, denounces” their crimes.37 It was here, in October 1860, that Westerners “threw off their mask of ‘democracy,’ ‘liberty,’ ‘solidarity,’ and ‘civilization,’ exposing underneath the cruel, vicious, and vile grin of an invader.”38 And so, a token of the vanity of one empire transforms into a token of the barbarity of another, reversing the roles of the ‘civilized’ and the ‘savage.’39
2.1.3   Sino–Japanese War
Moving on from the dying embers of Yuanmingyuan, there is something of a breathing spell, as—so the writings suggest—nothing noteworthy takes place until decades later. Nearing the close of the century, a skirmish for the Korean peninsula between China and Japan escalated into the First Sino–Japanese War (1894–95) that, in only six months, end-ed in yet another lopsided defeat for China.40 The Qing armies, disorganized and undisci-plined from general to grunt, were “put to rout both on land and at sea.”41 In the most humiliating display of military incompetence, the entire Beiyang fleet, mismanaged by bungling admirals, was sunk by Japanese warships—the Qing rulers’ thirty years’ attempts at catching up to the West were, literally, sent to the bottom of the Yellow Sea.42 The terms of China’s surrender, laid out in the Treaty of Shimonoseki (1895), “far surpassed all prior unequal treaties in severity.”43 To finance the heavy indemnity, “three times as large as the Qing government’s annual revenue,” China could only raise loans from the same powers that had “blackmailed” it since the Opium Wars, allowing them to reach ever deeper into China’s dilapidating economy.44 More tragic still was the cession of Taiwan, sentencing the compatriots there to Japan’s “savage colonial misrule,” “bloodsucking economic plun-der,” and “blatant ideological enslavement” for decades to come.45 This utter failure in the face of a “tiny” neighbor, the authors lament, “fully revealed the depth of the Great Qing’s decrepitude”: now that even the Japanese had broken through, the whole world rushed in on their heels in a “frenzied scramble to carve China up like a melon.”46 With the Qing court’s resources long depleted, and its enemies ever more numerous and greedy, little could be done to reverse the crisis. In just three years, foreign powers penetrated China from every angle—Russians to the north, Germans to the east, French to the south, British all the way along the coast—their “spheres of influence” dotting her enervated geobody from tip to toe.47
	As one author points out, the 1895 defeat neatly splits the ‘Century’ into two halves, not only in terms of actual time, but also with regard to the source and extent of China’s affliction. In the first half, China is brought under the yoke by “white colonialist-imperial-ists” hailing from afar, whereas in the second half an even greater menace appears on the Eastern horizon: a “yellow colonialist-imperialist,” separated only by “a narrow strip of water.”48 What makes Japan’s ascension all the more galling to the authors is that it was greatly facilitated by the reparations extracted from China: normally war cripples a nation, but this war “fattened Japan.”49 Having defected to the imperialist club, the Japanese keep stepping up their involvement in China’s torment toward the end of the ‘Century’ and, as we shall see, their crimes against the Chinese people will far outdo those of Westerners.50
2.1.4   Eight-Nation Alliance
The dust of the Sino–Japanese war had hardly settled when the Boxer movement (1898–1900) broke out. Here, a non-Chinese person very likely thinks of a ‘rebellion’: a faceless horde of peasants running amok, leaving behind them a trail of torched churches and mur-dered missionaries.51 In the writings, however, this perspective is turned inside out, with foreign invaders leaving a trail of torched homes and murdered peasants in their wake. There is rarely so much as a word on the Boxers themselves, apart from the odd eulogy as to their “patriotic” and “anti-imperialist” qualities.52 By contrast, the carnage wrought by the foreign relief force, deployed to subdue the Boxers in the summer of 1900, is dwelt upon in lurid detail. We are inundated, page after page, with the “maniacal arson, butchery, rape, and pillage” committed by foreign troops as they stormed Tianjin and Beijing, or swept the countryside on punitive expeditions.53 These “wolves and jackals,” one author reproves, killed and raped everyone in sight “for their amusement,” barging into homes and palaces to loot, and rounding people up in narrow alleys for rifle and bayonet exercise. Once the mayhem was over, streets were strewn with dead bodies, “left for wild dogs to chew on.”54 Such were the excesses of the invaders, that they even torched Yuanmingyuan a second time, burning down what little had been spared from or rebuilt after the first fire.55 Westerners, one author concludes, once again “made it perfectly clear as to what their ‘civilization’ really amounts to.”56
	If the defeat by Japan five years prior was devastating, the Boxer debacle was even more so. The authors insist that, at this juncture, China’s demise is imminent. That a total of eight powers (‘Eight-Nation Alliance’) participated in the expedition only adds to the sense of tightening encirclement—it is as if the entire world teamed up in an attempt to wipe China out in one decisive blow. This picture comes through with particular punch in the concluding negotiations, with representatives from virtually every eminent nation of the time on one side of the table, and Qing plenipotentiaries, outnumbered and forlorn, on the other.57 The Boxer Protocol (1901) signed thereby, the authors bewail, ratcheted the level of extortion up yet another notch. This “unprecedentedly humiliating and enslaving treaty . . . thoroughly deprived China of sovereignty,” pushing “the Chinese people to the verge of national extinction.”58 The onerous indemnity of 450 million taels in silver, calculated at one tael per Chinese subject,59 was the finishing touch in “reducing the Qing government to a puppet of imperialist rule.”60 Some authors go so far as to claim that “the magnitude of the indemnity, and the malice with which it was levied, are unsurpassed in the world.”61 China, no longer a country in its own right, thus “entered the twentieth century in heavy fetters.”62
2.1.5   Republic
From the inaugural Opium Wars all the way up to the Boxer Protocol, the authors clearly follow a common thread with little, if any variation. However, coming to the Republican era, they suddenly splinter off into several directions. Some castigate the abortive state formations of the time, warlord and Nationalist alike, for treachery and misgovernment, reminding us how the people suffered under the “reactionary rule” of one, or the “one-party dictatorship” of another.63 Other authors take a more sympathetic view, cautiously acknowledging the Nationalists’ contribution in abolishing most ‘unequal treaties.’64 Some relate how patriotic Chinese, on several occasions throughout the 1920s, rallied to protest against “imperialist enslavement and aggression,” only to be “ruthlessly and bloodily” put down by colonial police.65 Others still mourn China’s diplomatic humiliation in the Paris Peace Conference (1919), whereby German concessions in Shandong were awarded to Japan in spite of China’s vocal opposition: yet another case, sighs one author, of imperial-ists “dividing the spoils” among themselves under the guise of international law.66 Howev-er, with no clear-cut pattern to follow, most authors are at a loss what to say—so, they say nothing at all, and simply exclude the Republican years altogether.
	Among this cacophony, there nonetheless are a couple of events that show up with some regularity, though none are related even half as often, and never elaborated in as much detail as, for instance, the Opium Wars or the Eight-Nation Alliance. Foremost, of course, is the singularly important Xinhai Revolution (1911), whereby imperial China came to a close. A typical formulation is that Sun Yat-sen and his bourgeois acolytes “finally put an end to over two millenia of Chinese feudal autocratic monarchy”; yet this promising start turned out “a mere flash in the pan,” as “the fruits of the revolution fell into the hands of Yuan Shikai,” a notorious warlord and “running dog of imperialism.”67 Another event that is covered consistently is Japan’s ultimatum of ‘twenty-one demands’ (1915) that, incidentally, also involves Yuan the “archtraitor.”68 With the ‘demands,’ we are told, Japan aimed at nothing less than “annexing” and “eradicating” China,69 exposing “the diabolic rictus of Japanese imperialism” for all the world to see.70 Having “caught wind of Yuan Shikai’s schemes to restore monarchy,” the Japanese “lured” and “coerced” him into accepting the ‘demands’ by exploiting that ambition. Yuan gladly took the bait, “auction-ing the nation’s rights and interests in exchange for a crown”—truly he deserves to be “spat on by the whole nation.”71
2.1.6   War of Resistance
Approaching the last stretch of the ‘Century,’ the authors converge again into a single voice, and shift back into high gear: the crescendo of violence meted out to the Chinese finally culminates in the Second Sino–Japanese War (1937–45) or, as the Chinese call it, the ‘War of Resistance.’ Strikingly, in the writings, there is very little in the way of military history, as in strategy and tactics, offense and defense, key engagements, orders of battle, and the like. The Mukden incident (1931) that foreshadowed the war, and the battle of Lu-gouqiao (1937) that opened Japan’s all-out invasion are habitually singled out—but only in name.72 Instead, Japanese cruelties are enumerated at great length and in graphic detail. The reader is exposed to a ghoulish collage of murder, torture, mutilation, rape, arson, chemical and biological warfare, even “bayoneting of genitalia and anuses”73—an orgy of terror “for the entertainment” of the “devils.”74 In this respect, no other event stands out as painfully as the Nanjing massacre (1937), in which Japanese troops overran the then capi-tal of the Republic, raping and slaughtering a great portion of the city’s civilian population, children and elderly alike. “Once inside the walls,” writes one author, “the Japanese com-mitted, without a qualm, every enormity that the human mind can conceive.”75 No sensi-bility is spared in depicting the methodology, from burning and burying alive to beheading and eviscerating, from gouging out eyes and hearts to extracting fetuses, from gang rape and forced incest to necrophilia and cannibalism.76 The voyeuristic snapshots of death—pierced throats “spurting blood like a fountain,” war dogs “ripping people to a bloody pulp,” victims hung over a fire and “slowly barbecued,” or “doused with gasoline,” set a-light, and sent “thrashing and writhing” in a ball of fire—are regularly accompanied by the “applause,” “cheering,” and “laughter” of Japanese soldiers, who appear to derive much hilarity from the suffering.77 This six-week carnage is, understandably, remembered in China with profound resentment as the worst of all the atrocities perpetrated on the nation, and continues to “envelop the relations between the two countries in a noxious miasma.”78
	The ‘War of Resistance’ is indeed a dismal episode, and a worthy apex of a century of torment and disgrace. “More than thirty million compatriots laid down their dear lives, countless towns and villages were pounded into rubble, and the entire nation hovered on the verge of death,” one author sums up, “the tremendous material losses and mental trau-ma sustained by our people, not to mention the damage and degeneration that befell our society, are beyond imagination.”79 Yet, as the qualifier ‘resistance’ implies, there is more to this ordeal than mere death and bereavement. Besides marking the absolute low point of the ‘Century,’ the war also heralds the turnaround in fortunes for the Chinese, whereupon the moribund nation, after untold failures and humiliations, finally wins a “complete and conclusive victory” over its oppressors.80 It is not uncommon to see the war celebrated as a kind of laboratory of racial/ethnic viability: “the War of Resistance,” reflects one author, “tried the Chinese people’s ability to defend their homeland and save their race from per-il,” and they passed this trial with flying colors.81 “Amid this battle for survival,” rejoices another, “the Chinese race, a loose sheet of sand, was reborn as a nation, like a Phoenix rising from the ashes.”82 The ‘Century’ then draws to a close, and a proud and independent ‘New China’ emerges from the rubble with the founding of the People’s Republic (PRC) in 1949. “The Chinese people stood up,” concludes one author, citing the famous words of Chairman Mao. “Gone were the days when imperialists could bully and oppress China at will. Gone were the days of warlordism, disunity, strife, and disaster. Gone, never to return.”83
*   *   *
This concludes our chronological rundown of the ‘Century.’ We should now have a fair impression of the dominant layout in the writings. We have seen that, if anything, the ‘Century’ is recounted in terms of China’s collision with Western and Japanese imperialism. The twin keynotes of this encounter are, first, the wars of aggression against China, all of which (save for one) ended in its defeat; and second, the ‘unequal treaties’ that enshrined those defeats in a piecemeal dismemberment of territory, dismantling of sovereignty, and boundless extension of foreign privileges on Chinese soil. Alongside this general war–treaty pattern, a number of iconically significant events (most notably the burning and looting of Yuanmingyuan, the invasion of the Eight-Nation Alliance, and the Nanjing massacre) are singled out and limned in excruciating detail, presenting foreign inhumanity and Chinese suffering at their worst. This all adds up to a morbid image of China, beleaguered and without allies, at the mercy of foreign predators pressing in ever more deeply with each successive assault—a downward spiral through a series of hardships and humiliations, each one more crippling than the last.84
	There certainly is no small amount of truth in this view. After all, it is quite impossible to imagine the late Qing and Republican periods apart from the encroachment, both physical and symbolic, of Western imperialism. But still, does this not seem a bit too uncomplicated? Is foreign violence really all there is to modern Chinese history? It should be safe to assume that producing and maintaining such a black-and-white picture of the past requires that something is ‘forgotten.’
2.2   Forgetting
Anyone familiar with China’s modern past should find the foregoing account incomplete in some respects. Needless to say, no evocation of the past is ‘complete’ in the true sense of the word—the past is never fully retrievable, and even the retrievable parts are subject to interpretation, simplification, and selection by the historian.85 Even so, we can evaluate the completeness of any history in terms of what exactly it leaves unsaid. There is a decisive difference between omitting something because it is of little or no historical significance, and omitting something, no matter how significant, because it would rather be passed over in silence by those looking back on it from the present. In this section, we are interested only in gaps of the latter kind. We will discuss a number of events that, for their sheer historical weight, should be part of any reading of China’s modern past, yet for whatever reason are systematically ignored or reworked in the ‘Century’ writings. In the process, a pattern of ‘forgetting’ becomes readily apparent.
2.2.1   Taipings
The first third of the ‘Century,’ as recounted in the writings, is practically synonymous with the Opium Wars. We are told of British gunboat diplomacy, the dysfunction of the Qing court, the vast asymmetry in military capabilities between the two sides, the imposi-tion of the treaty system, the pillage and burning of the imperial gardens, and so forth. It is as if all of China were, in one way or another, tied up fighting off the British. This image, however, is misleading; in reality, the Chinese were tied up fighting among themselves. At the time, the Qing government was so entangled in domestic turmoil—insurgent minori-ties, secret societies, military mutinies, Ming loyalists—that trespassing Europeans at the fringes of the empire were only a minor concern.86 No other event shaped the historical course of nineteenth century China as profoundly as the Taiping civil war (1850–64), the massive quasi-religious uprising that for years held sway over much of the country and, though eventually put down, came just a hair short of toppling the dynasty—and, costing some twenty to thirty million lives, remains to date the deadliest civil war in world histo-ry.87 As Julia Lovell points out, it is quite fair to say that the “British trouble,” in compari-son, was little more than “a sideshow.”88
	Yet the authors neglect this side of the story altogether. The smaller-scale disturbances notwithstanding, one is hard pressed to find any mention even of the Taipings. Only where residues of Maoist historiography linger, there may appear a paragraph applauding them as an “anti-imperialist, anti-feudalist” peasant revolution.89 But even then, the authors side-step the distasteful realities—mass civilian murder, famine and plague, ethnic hatred, mes-sianic hallucinations90—and instead present a very particular ‘revolutionary’ vision: the Taipings, we are told, “gave full expression to the strength of will and patriotic spirit of the Chinese people,”91 and “struck a heavy blow against foreign invaders and feudal forces.”92 Some go out of their way to claim that the Taipings’ wrath was actually directed at “impe-rialism and its running dogs,” praising how they “stood firm and undaunted in the face of foreign aggressors” and, quite fantastically, “safeguarded national dignity and territorial sovereignty.”93 One author, without elaborating how exactly this happened, alleges that the Taipings “shattered the Western invaders’ dreams of colonizing China.”94 Thus, the single most pivotal (and bloody) event in nineteenth century China, if not edited out entirely, is neutered to an ahistorical cliché, and sandwiched between the two overblown Opium Wars.
2.2.2   Yuanmingyuan
But if the ravages of the Taiping revolt have slipped from memory, the same cannot be said of the pillage of Yuanmingyuan. Instead of the millions of Chinese who died by each other’s hands, the authors mourn the treasures that were either stolen or destroyed when British and French troops raided the imperial gardens: the “bullion, jewelry, and cultural relics,” the “bronzeware, porcelain, and antiques,” the “famous paintings and calligraphy,” the “historical records and classics.”95 As discussed earlier, this incident is greatly played up in the writings, both as the bruising climax of the Opium War arc, and as testimony to the foreign aggressors’ barbarity.
	Yet, for all the attention lavished on this event, it too is subject to memory attrition. For one, it is generally implied that the Anglo–French force looted and torched the gardens just for sport. This is not quite true. What escapes the authors’ recollection is that, behind this act of vandalism, there was an all too familiar motive—revenge. Earlier that autumn, Qing officials had detained a British delegation headed to the capital on diplomatic business. The envoys were incarcerated and tortured such that, upon their release, half of their number had perished and, in the words of Geremie Barmé, “when their bodies were eventually returned to the Allied forces in October 1860, even the liberal use of lime in their coffins could not conceal the fact that they had suffered horribly before expiring.”96 The sacking of Yuanmingyuan, then, was not a random enactment of bestial impulse, but rather tit-for-tat for this unseemly murder and breach of diplomatic protocol.97 Disgraceful behavior nevertheless.
	Moreover, it is insisted that the foreign troops, in a mere three days, somehow man-aged to send the entire complex up in smoke. “Yuanmingyuan was engulfed in a sea of flames,” we are told, “leaving behind nothing but dust and ashes.”98 Again, this does not quite coincide with what actually happened. In reality, as Barmé notes, a good part of the precincts was spared from this notorious “conflagration.” It was only later, at the hands of the Chinese themselves, that the devastation was completed. Abandoned, the emperor’s summer refuge became a stockpile of spare parts, free for anyone to salvage. Over the fol-lowing century, the remaining pavilions and villas were dismantled by resourceful locals and unruly Bannermen, brick by brick, for whatever need: building materials, tradables, firewood, famine food. The man-made hillocks and ponds were leveled down, filled in, and converted into farmland by destitute vagrants streaming into the capital and pushing the urban sprawl further into the outskirts. What fire did not consume in 1860 had, a hundred years later, been displaced by a huddle of shacks and heaps of garbage.99 There no longer is any trace of this domestic neglect and misuse, however, now that the shanties have been bulldozed, the residents relocated elsewhere, and the site designated a ‘patriotic education base,’ where Chinese are officially encouraged to reflect upon the (foreign-imposed) horrors of the ‘Century.’100
2.2.3   Boxers
The logic of forgetting should by now be fairly evident. Even so, to be on the safe side, let us still consider the disjunctures in the Boxer episode. As we have seen, the writings focus overwhelmingly on the bloody rampage of the Eight-Nation expeditionary force in the summer of 1900, while the long chain of events that led up to it—that is, the Boxer part of the story—is downplayed significantly. Never do the authors trace the underlying causes of the movement: the floods and drought that decimated the harvest in northwestern China, leaving legions of young men idle and hungry (a sure recipe for trouble), many of whom were then drawn to the rapidly emerging Boxing schools.101 Nor do the authors touch on the magico-religious beliefs and practices, from spirit possession to invulnerabili-ty claims—the Boxers’ trademark feature—that made the movement so appealing to that surplus of famished young men.102 And, although approving of the Boxers’ anti-foreign violence, the authors do not face up to the fact that most of that violence was actually vent-ed on other Chinese. The Boxers were resolved to purge the country of foreign influence, and if they were to do so root and branch, so they believed, all native Chinese who had been ‘tainted’ by such influence would have to be culled as well. Thus, as the movement ballooned and spread out from rural Shandong, the Boxers avidly detected “secondary hairy ones” everywhere among the populace and lynched them on the spot, burning down homes, hacking off limbs, lopping off heads, flaying and burying people alive, murdering “untold thousands” of their kin.103 The few hundred Western casualties, compared to the wholesale slaughter that the Boxers wreaked on their fellow countrymen, were a drop in the bucket.
	The depiction in the writings is something else entirely. Not unlike the Taipings, the Boxers are romanticized as “anti-imperialist patriots” who rallied for “the defense of the motherland,” and “met death with a smile as they gave imperialist invaders a handsome flogging.”104 Put bluntly, the reality of famished teen mobs massacring their compatriots, while calling upon the Monkey King for magical bulletproofing, would rest uneasily alongside this idealization. Small wonder, then, that the authors are so loath to address the pre-1900 events. Most dismiss this part altogether, and cut straight to the finale. Others throw in a red herring about the “economic and cultural infiltration” of Christianity: it was not the Boxers who “tyrannized” the countryside, they insist, but devious Western clergy-men working in cahoots with “local despots, thugs, and desperadoes.” And so the Boxers enter the stage as people’s heroes who, instead of killing their neighbors, “administered punishment to peasant-oppressing missionaries.”105 One author breaks ranks by chiding the Boxers for their “backwardness,” their “lack of discipline and organization,” even their “feudal superstitions” and “sweeping xenophobia” that drove them to attack railways and telegraph lines. Yet, ultimately, he too falls back in line, and joins the chorus praising the Boxers as righteous patriots and revolutionary exemplars.106
	Clearly, within the narrative structure of the ‘Century,’ the Boxer movement is of no relevance apart from its violent suppression by imperialist powers. Many authors, in fact, invert the causal relationship between the two, implying that the Boxers sprang up abrupt-ly only after the foreign contingent had set foot in China. However, as it makes no sense that an uprising should break out after it is put down, the quelling has to be thought of as an ‘invasion.’107 In some cases this interpretive freedom is streched even further, such that the Boxers are not brought up at all, making it seem as though foreigners, once again, “launched a barbaric war against China” for no other reason than their unabating malevo-lence.108 Thus this interval, by a rhetorical sleight of hand, transforms into yet another ‘war of aggression against China,’ seamlessly adding to the long line since Britain in 1840 “blasted open China’s gates with cannon and opium.”109
2.2.4   Republic
In light of the above discussion, it would be nigh impossible not to discern a pattern: in the writings, there is a striking tendency to foreground the ‘foreign’ and relegate the ‘domes-tic’ to the margins. Or, in terms of memory, miseries heaped on the Chinese by foreign powers are ‘over-remembered,’ whereas tragedies caused by the Chinese themselves are conveniently ‘forgotten.’ We have demonstrated at some length how this works out. The Opium Wars are inflated into an epochal conflict that swallowed China whole and almost capsized the Qing dynasty, when in reality this honor belongs to the Taiping civil war—a purely domestic affair. The Taipings, in turn, are burned from memory by the flames of Yuanmingyuan that the authors so passionately stoke. The homicidal spree of the Eight-Nation military coalition is brought to the fore, yet the bloodshed unleashed by the Boxers, certainly on par with the former, is invariably hushed up.
	This also explains the authors’ reluctance to engage the Republican era. In the early twentieth century, as the fabric of the empire unraveled, the country was divided and con-vulsed by ceaseless infighting between reformists, revolutionaries, and regional kingpins of all hues. Meanwhile, the First World War set Western powers at each other’s throats, affording China a welcome breather from their harassment. As a result, these years are marked by a dearth of foreign incursion on the one hand, and an excess of internecine con-flict on the other. Considering how the authors work toward conveying just the opposite, it is not hard to see their plight. Now and then there is a remark on how China was “torn apart among separatist warlords”;110 even after the fall of the empire, “the people still were not the masters in the house,” what with the rogue armies and Nationalists rattling sabers with one another.111 Few authors, however, concede even this much. It is more common to displace attention from the troubles at home to some minor wrange with a foreign power—as noted earlier, a recurring favorite is Japan’s ‘twenty-one demands’ and Yuan Shikai’s shameful capitulation thereto. Still, most authors resort to the same device that got them through the Taipings and the Boxers—deletion—skipping straight from the 1901 Boxer Protocol to the Japanese forays of 1937–45. Remarkably, not one author elaborates on the protracted civil war between Communists and Nationalists that raged intermittently from 1927 to 1949 and, very much akin to the onslaught of imperialism, witnessed the extent of man’s inhumanity to man at its worst, leaving hundreds of thousands dead.112 It is fair to say that Yuan Shikai’s clandestine transactions were but froth in comparison.
2.2.5   Deviations
Yet even foreign misconduct, despite the disproportionate emphasis it receives, is not without omissions. A number of events that would perfectly fit into the pattern, curiously, remain in the dark. For one, the Sino–French War (1884–85) crops up only rarely, even as it bears all the hallmarks of imperialist aggression.113 Likewise neglected is the Treaty of Aigun (1858), whereby Czarist Russia “annexed 600,000 square kilometers of Chinese territory north of Heilongjiang,” accounting for the largest single cession among all ‘un-equal treaties’114—Hong Kong and Taiwan are minuscule in comparison, yet few authors fail to bemoan their surrender. More perplexing still is the near total silence on the Lüshun massacre (1894) that, with the indiscriminate slaughter of civilians and the nailing of babies to walls, resonates closely with the imagery of the Nanjing massacre. After the city fell, one author relates, the Japanese “slew everyone in sight, be it soldiers or civilians, men or women, old or young . . . Lüshun, in the blink of an eye, turned into an empty, des-olate ghost town.”115 In one particularly gruesome scene, the Japanese herd captives into a small pond, encircle them, and start firing and hacking at them from all sides, churning up a “shrieking jumble of disengaged heads, severed limbs, split torsos, and ruptured bellies.” The living “scramble to stay afloat among the gore, still crying for mercy”—their pleads are met with “a roar of laughter,” and more thrusts of the bayonet.116 Just as little attention is devoted to a comparable incident on the banks of the Amur in 1900, in which “Russian troops drove thousands of Chinese villagers into the river where they either drowned or were stabbed, axed, or shot to death. The water ran red with blood, and floating corpses choked the river.”117 For one more example, while the violence of the ‘War of Resistance’ is expounded for pages on end, the Mengeleian experimentation on Chinese captives car-ried out by ‘Unit 731’ of the Japanese army, with the vivisections and the bubonic plague, is mysteriously absent from most accounts.118
	Why is it that such powerful and potent events are left in a footnote? Perhaps revisit-ing every detail of every massacre that took place over the one hundred and some years would risk trivializing the horror and benumbing the reader. Perhaps not all lost territories, no matter how large, are as heavily invested with meaning as, say, Hong Kong and Taiwan (both of which are nationalistic sore spots). Perhaps the Sino–French War was waged too far from home, and the Qing military performed all too well, such that it would seem out of place alongside the other, much more humiliating defeats. Or, perhaps most authors do not so much ‘pick out’ events, as simply follow a well-established narrative template. But conjectures aside, we need not worry about these deviations—they are too few and too minor to compromise the main point of this section. Even if the authors do not highlight every foreign transgression, still, they do consistently overlook every Chinese act of the sort. We may safely conclude that the ‘Century,’ without a doubt, is a product of ‘selective amnesia.’
2.3   Conclusion
In this chapter, we have done two things. First, we extracted a canonical understanding of the ‘Century’ from a cluster of Chinese-language texts, ending up with a rather melodra-matic story of how China was humiliated, enslaved, tortured, and brought within a hair’s breadth of extinction at the hands of foreign powers. Then, by identifying a number of holes and gaps in this story, we demonstrated that the canonical understanding is reductive and one-sided: most notably, it leaves out the parts where the Chinese themselves bully, torment, and kill one another. We were thus right to take the ‘Century’ with a grain of salt—though historical memory need not by definition be misaligned with historical reality, here it quite clearly is.
	Not only does the ‘Century’ forget large chunks of the past—it does so very methodi-cally. As our analysis shows, there is a consistent pattern to what the authors fail to recol-lect. Objectively speaking, China was throughout its modern history beset by both external and internal complications: apart from the encroachment of imperialist powers on Chinese lands, there was also a good deal of internecine blood-letting in the form of consecutive civil wars, rebellions, and revolutions. However, as the titular ‘humiliation’ suggests, the ‘Century’ is remembered much less for the strife within, than for the blows showered on China from without. Fatal military defeats and atrocities at the hands of foreigners are meticulously enumerated along with the ‘unequal treaties’ brought about thereby, while the various home-brewn troubles are carefully kept under wraps. In short, the ‘Century’ accounts only for violence against, never among Chinese.
	The unmistakably selective nature of such forgetting suggests that it is anything but accidental. William Callahan, who has done a similar analysis with essentially the same results as ours, argues that this indeed is so. According to him, events such as the Taiping civil war, despite (or precisely because of) their immense historical significance, are delib-erately excluded from the chronology, because they run afoul of the moral narrative of good, civilized Chinese versus bad, barbaric foreigners.119 This, in effect, is to say that the ‘Century’ serves not so much historiographical as moralistic purposes; that those writing the history of national humiliation are, in fact, less concerned with understanding the past as it was, than with imposing on the past an understanding of their own. Thus, we return to what was discussed at the beginning of this chapter: that the present weighs on the past just as the past on the present. This idea of ‘reading history backwards’—that historical facts are selectively overridden by present-day sensibilities—nicely leads us to the next chapter.
3   Myth
Paul Cohen, in his 1997 tour de force on the Boxer movement, investigates three very dif-ferent ways of “knowing the past”: as experienced by contemporaries at the time, as recon-structed by historians at a later date, and as fiddled with by “mythologizers.”120 Pertinent to our discussion, in particular, is the contrast between the latter two. In the operational sense, historians and mythologizers are no different in that they both interpret past events, with the advantage of hindsight, by gluing together the bits and pieces of evidence left behind. Their motives, however, are just the opposite. While it is the historian’s calling to under-stand the past as truthfully as possible, mythologizers, by contrast, chip away at that under-standing—rather than make sense of the past, they seek to exploit its symbolic resources for their own purposes in the present. While the historian carefully weighs the evidence and draws conclusions therefrom, the mythologizer bends the evidence to fit the conclu-sion they had in mind all along. The historian produces an impartial and nuanced view of the past, raising a new question for each old one answered; the mythologizer, a one-sided and simplistic half-truth that dismisses any further questions.121
	The previous chapter closed on the note that the ‘Century of national humiliation,’ instead of elucidating the past, reduces it to a morality tale—and deliberately so. With this in mind, it should be immediately obvious how Cohen’s argument comes into play here. Indeed, does not our foregoing discussion resonate closely with what Cohen says about myth? What is ‘selective forgetting’ if not censorship and sanitization—that is, tinkering with evidence? What is the history thus produced but ahistorical—biased, misleading, incomplete? Do not our findings indicate that the ‘Century’ is less about getting the past ‘right,’ than about imposing on the past a reading that, for whatever reason, is preferable to what actually happened?
	If so, then what might that reading be? What kind of a story, exactly, is the past made to convey, even if against the grain of historical reality? This is the question that the pres-ent chapter hopes to address. So far, we have seen which parts of the past make it through the sieve (and which do not), and thus have a general idea of the chronology of the ‘Centu-ry.’ Next, we will examine more specifically what kind of a master narrative is spun out of that disjointed sequence of events. In fact, instead of one, we can readily discern three overlapping narratives that turn up so consistently as to demand consideration—namely, the stories of victimization, corruption, and resistance. In the following, each will be dis-cussed in turn in its own section. Much like in the previous chapter, our approach here is mostly descriptive; critical evaluation is left to the concluding remarks. Though we took Cohen’s incisive analysis as a point of departure, we will not return to it until at the end of the chapter. Nonetheless, the relevance of ‘myth,’ and why these stories are to be regarded as such, should become clear along the way.
	Again, there is little support to be had from secondary literature, so we will have to rely on the same corpus of Chinese-language texts (the ‘writings’) as earlier. For this rea-son, it may be worthwhile to repeat the caveat made at the outset of the previous chapter (on page 9). To avoid having to browse back and forth, let me just express the same thing in the words of Wang Zheng: the purpose “is not to recount history, but rather to focus on how the Chinese remember history.”122
3.1   Victimization
Of the three stories we are about to examine, one is categorically privileged over the other two. As to what that story is, our earlier analysis of remembering and forgetting has already delivered some important clues. Consider, once again, how the ‘Century’ allows only for violence against, and never among Chinese, thus reducing China’s modern past to a cumulative timeline of foreign-imposed humiliations. It takes no stretch of the imagina-tion to see that, if anything, the ‘Century’ seeks to portray China as a victim. In this re-spect, the writings really speak for themselves, so let us start off with a few excerpts:
“Practically all imperialist powers in the world, small and large alike, pounced on China like ravening wolves, and exploited her adversity by force and trickery. They coerced Chi-na into signing more than a thousand unequal treaties and conventions, and thus enforced their authority over all aspects of Chinese society, be it politics, economy, culture, military or foreign affairs, subjecting the Chinese people to the most barbaric forms of tyranny and extortion.”123
“Imperialist powers dragged China deeper and deeper into semi-colonialism, stretching their tentacles into every nook and cranny, from the frontiers and coasts deep into the heartland, from politics and economy through to thought and culture. Step by step, they set up a superstructure of systematic oppression.”124
“Under the holocaust of foreign capitalists, the independent and territorially unified China was deprived of sovereignty and smashed to smithereens, the vast and abundant empire was enfeebled and bankrupted, and the people were reduced to poverty and destitution. This is the blood-spattered portrait of semi-colonial, semi-feudal China . . . this is the har-rowing history of the Chinese people’s terrible humiliation under foreign domination.”125
“The wars of aggression, one after the other, written in blood and fire; the recurring bouts of rape, pillage, and murder; the confiscation and carving up of our land, piece by piece; the countless treaties that forfeited our sovereignty and put us to shame. Thousands upon thousands of common people were sent to the depths of desolation, invaluable antiques and immeasurable fortunes were plundered bare. The rivers and mountains of the mother-land were drawn and quartered, her cultural magnificence was trampled underfoot, her people were brought down like lambs to the slaughter. Our homeland was bruised and battered all over, our nation was subjected to the most egregious humiliations.”126
	These excerpts, more so than any other passages quoted in the course of this thesis, capture the essence of the ‘Century’—victimization at the hands of imperialism. In this section, we will examine this story of how evil foreigners deprived China of agency, and forced upon her a new historical trajectory (a downward one, obviously), while the Chi-nese, with their hands tied, could do little more than look on from the sidelines.
3.1.1   Rhetoric
In the quotes above, perhaps what catches the eye most readily is the language. It should not startle us, however—as we must have noticed already in the previous chapter, a similar tone runs throughout the writings. Indeed, in trying to make a case for Chinese victim-hood, the authors rely less on argument and evidence, than on this kind of emotive rhetoric—and, sure enough, almost every page is laced with it. This language places China in a passive and immobile position, at the mercy of an overwhelming multitude of enemies who hold the initiative at every turn. Note how the passive voice is reserved solely for China, and the active voice for foreigners: the former is the patient upon which an action is performed, and the latter the agent performing that action. Foreign imperialists “impose,” “enforce,” and “coerce” at will, to their heart’s content, while China is submissively on the receiving end, as if in a state of paralysis, “dragged,” “deprived,” “brought down,” and “trampled underfoot.” This language also creates the sense that the onslaught is pervasive and systematic, that the enemies’ “tentacles” penetrate every last cell of the Chinese body politic: all corners of the “vast and abundant lands,” the corridors of power, the imperial coffers, the people’s pockets—even their minds. As an abiding reminder of China’s de-basement at alien hands, words such as “shame,” “humiliation,” “disgrace,” and “indigni-ty,” in all their possible permutations, thickly populate the pages.
	Let us illustrate this further with typical passages from the writings. Observe here, in particular, how language is used to reinforce the image of China as an abject victim. “Imperialist countries of all shapes and sizes thrust their claws toward China,” writes one author, “they saw China as a slab of fatty meat that they could cut up and devour as they pleased.”127 “In the one hundred years up to the end of the War of Resistance,” asserts an-other, “invaders from almost twenty countries trespassed on our lands, looted our property, massacred our kindred, and violated our sovereignty.”128 Overpowered, China reeled under one blow after another, her frontiers breached on all sides such that “not an inch of Chi-nese soil was left untrodden by the iron hooves of invading armies.”129 The scourge of war swept over the faltering empire, as foreigners prowled high and low, “wantonly pillaging the riches of China and brutally butchering its people.”130 Wherever the barbarians went, “crops were ruined, homes burnt, and graves defiled. The people were mired in death and despair, and weeping and wailing echoed across the land.”131 To add insult to injury, the imperialists forced weak Chinese governments into signing ‘unequal treaties’—well over a thousand of them, most authors claim132—that invested the ruthless exploitation with an aura of legality. These treaties, a ritualistic complaint goes, “disgraced the nation and destroyed its sovereignty.”133 They were like “shackles upon shackles latched onto the Chinese people”;134 like “ropes upon ropes strangling the motherland breathless”; or, even more poignantly, like “so many cleavers cutting the motherland bloody and bruised from head to toe.”135
	Given such language, the writings often take on a fable-like quality. Foreigners, with their claws, hooves, and penchant for violence, are likened to predators, and China, that tempting slab of meat, to defenseless prey—a hapless victim. History is thus presented in allegorical form, with a strong visceral appeal: wolves from afar gather upon the sheeplike China, attack her from all sides, tie her down, and then have their way with her, wreaking the most frightful devastation on her whole being. The Chinese people, with their hands and feet bound, can do little but cry and wail as the motherland is bled and dismembered before their eyes.
3.1.2   Suffering
In framing China as a victim, the authors also tap into the memory of the nation’s premod-ern greatness. The way they see it, the ‘Century’ appears all the more dismal when viewed against the heights from which China was hauled down. Many accounts begin with an iconography of past cultural achievement and grandeur, from the “four great inventions” to “five thousand years of civilization,” showcasing how China used to be “at the top of the world,”136 radiating brilliance and “making universally recognized contributions to the progress of humankind.”137 These vague images of past glory, no doubt, are less to cele-brate that glory in and of itself, than to set the ‘Century’ into even sharper relief. “As histo-ry entered the nineteenth century,” laments one author, “ancient China bade farewell to her last era of prosperity—the heyday of the Kangxi, Yongzheng, and Qianlong emperors—only to usher in the tempest of imperialist aggression.”138 “When China thrived, tribute missions from all nations came and went without pause,” notes another, “but when China fell into decay, she was cut up like cattle . . . and squeezed to the periphery of the world stage.”139 Here, the idea that China in premodern times was the highest of the high is somehow supposed to validate the idea that in modern times she was reduced to the lowest of the low. Some authors express this in no uncertain terms: the depredations of the ‘Cen-tury,’ “too many to recount,” are “unprecedented both in China and abroad, both in the past and the present. Especially to the Chinese nation, that once prided itself as the ‘Celes-tial Empire,’ they are a howling disgrace unheard of before or since.”140
	Not only do the authors try to convince us that the Chinese were victimized; as the last quote exemplifies, there is also a palpable need to persuade us further that China had it worse than all others. To this end, the superlative degree is used lavishly. Recall from the previous chapter how, for instance, the destruction of Yuanmingyuan, “the greatest of all gardens in the world,” is deemed “an unheard of calamity in the history of human civiliza-tion,” or how the “malevolence” behind the Boxer indemnity is said to be “unsurpassed in the world.” While such claims to greatest adversity are littered throughout, not unexpect-edly, they peak at the ‘War of Resistance.’ “The inhumanity, brutality, and rapacity of Japanese militarists is without parallel in history,” one author reproaches, “the horrific carnage they wrought upon the Chinese is the most barbaric and merciless in world history.”141 “The Nanjing massacre is the record-setting bloodbath in the history of modern warfare,” purports another, “it is the most savage and heinous page in the annals of human civilization.” Here, the human losses incurred by other World War II belligerents provide an important point of reference. For instance, the authors commonly insist (as if for fear of being outclassed) that Japanese atrocities in China were, if not worse, at least as bad as those of Nazi Germany in Europe. “More than thirty million [sic] Chinese people perished by the sword of the Japanese invaders,” one author notes suggestively, “whereas Hitler’s Germany has a record of only some twenty million kills.”142 With all these “mosts” and “worsts” in “world history,” there is little doubt as to what the authors are driving at: that no other nation holds a candle to China’s suffering. Occasionally this notion is stretched perhaps a bit too far, with rather unsavory results. For instance, some claim that the west-ward trafficking of Chinese “coolies” was “so dreadful as to put even the black slave trade to shame.”143
3.1.3   Foreigners
If China is always the victim, then foreigners must always be the bully, and the two must never be confused with one another. To be sure, the authors make exactly this distinction. “I discern two threads running throughout China’s modern history,” as one author puts it, “first, there is the invaders’ overweening ambition, which I am compelled to name the ‘black thread’; second, there are the sincere and pure hearts of the countless sons and daughters of China, which I shall name the ‘red thread.’”144 To have these two “threads” run parallel yet never intersect, the authors depict foreigners as a thoroughly corrupt entity, set off sharply from Chinese innocence and integrity. In this they resort, first and foremost, to vilification. Foreigners are at every turn disparaged as “rogues” and “barbarians” or, a step further, dehumanized as “beasts” and “devils.” The “monstrous crimes” of these “fiends,” who “stopped at no enormity,” are excoriated in the harshest terms.145 An ubiqui-tous complaint is how these “wolves and jackals,” in cold blood and with insatiable appe-tite, “carved China up like a melon”146—little did they care that every morsel of that melon was “indivisibly a part of China’s sacred territory since time immemorial.”147 It is categori-cally denied that the foreigners’ presence was anything but inimical, or their motives any-thing but insidious. They were “bandits” and “buccaneers,” every last one of them, guided much less by moral considerations than by “thug logic.”148 Even missionaries “partook in the onslaught in ways too numerous to count,” from “gathering intelligence” to “dispos-sessing and oppressing the people”; it was these men of God who were “in the vanguard of the charge,” their “hands spattered with Chinese blood.”149 At times, such vitriol borders on farcical. One author, for instance, sees yet another chance to sow superlatives, and describes the foreign bullies as “the most savage and shameless gangsters in the history of human civilization.”150 Another likens Britain to a “god of cannibalism,” and calls West-erners “imperialist vampires” that “threw a man-eating fête on this divine soil, day and night feasting gluttonously on Chinese flesh and blood.”151
	Do the Chinese authors really cast foreigners in such an unflattering light, or am I, knowingly or unwittingly, misreading the writings? To address such doubts, it may be worth noting that William Callahan’s (who may well be considered an authority on the topic) analysis reveals a very similar picture—so similar, in fact, that his observations are directly applicable here. He reports that foreigners “are written into Chinese history as a wholly negative force: invaders, capitalists, imperialists, barbarians, and devils, who are ‘pirates’ when on the sea, and ‘bandits’ when on land.” The texts that Callahan has studied habitually recount how “Japanese soldiers laughed when killing Chinese people, while imperialists exploited China with a combination of smiles, laughs, and snickers,” so as to make it seem as though they “actually enjoyed slaughtering, raping, torching, and looting China.” The reader is thus led to believe that the foreigners’ actions “come less from a rational pursuit of international trade or national interest, than from moral and psychologi-cal problems.”152 Does this not coincide exactly with what we have described above?
3.1.4   Ambivalence
As just shown, the image of foreigners in the ‘Century’ writings is thoroughly negative, sometimes to the point of absurdity. Yet, beneath all the venom, there is also a hint of am-bivalence. On the one hand, the authors rake foreigners over the coals mercilessly; on the other, they seek confirmation for their views from none other than foreigners themselves. Accordingly, renowned Western contemporaries who denounced the imperialist action in China and thus, in a sense, sided with the Chinese, are routinely quoted in the writings. A recurring favorite is Victor Hugo’s dismay at the sacking of Yuanmingyuan, chastising Britain and France as “two bandits . . . one plundering [the garden], the other setting it ablaze.”153 One author dedicates half an article to enlisting the incensed voices of Lenin, Marx, Mark Twain, and many others.154 Strikingly, the accounts that make the most use of such quotes are also the ones that rain the most brimstone on foreigners. One author throws the richest repertoire of pejorative epithets at “foreign demons” and their “pirate civilization,” yet takes every chance to cite the aggrieved Marxes and Victor Hugos to support his indignation.155
	What we see here likely are symptoms of what Peter Hays Gries has termed “the Kis-singer complex”: it is the extreme patriots whose dislike for foreigners runs deepest that, paradoxically, also have the strongest craving for words of praise and affirmation from abroad, as though agreeable nods from foreign luminaries somehow validated the Chinese case in the eyes of “world opinion.”156 On a deeper level still, these mixed attitudes may also reflect China’s ever-unresolved quandary between tradition and modernity, whereby the West is seen both as a threat to authentic ‘Chineseness,’ as well as an example on which a modern China should be modeled—as something that must be both excluded and embraced at once.157 This is nicely illustrated by the dual meaning attached to China’s eventual victory in the ‘War of Resistance.’ On the one hand, the authors celebrate the defeat and expulsion of foreign bullies: the country is rid of the imperialists’ cancerous presence, and the nation thus saved from extinction. Yet, on the other—and this is where that curious ambivalence toward the West rears it head—they take joy and pride in China’s being acknowledged by those same bullies:
“On September 2, 1945, the signing ceremony of Japan’s surrender was held aboard the USS Missouri. General MacArthur, Supreme Commander for the Allies, signed first, the American representative was second in line, and the Chinese representative, General Xu Yongchang, followed right after. Only then was it the turn of Britain, the USSR, Australia, Canada, France, and others. The seating order on such occasions indicates each country’s relative standing. It is thus evident from this that China had entered the ranks of great powers, and was now regarded highly by the West . . . The War of Resistance enhanced China’s international standing and prestige, earning the Chinese race wide respect from all the peoples of the world.”158
*   *   *
In this section we have seen how the authors wrap China into a cocoon of victimhood. To begin with, there is the ‘selective amnesia’ that we have discussed earlier: that is to say, the authors pretend that certain parts of the past never happened. Aside from this, they apply a layer of color over the remembered parts. Here, rather than rely on argument and evidence, they fall back on rhetoric and assertion. The conviction that the ‘Century’ was brought on China from the outside, and that the Chinese people were only bystanders to a hundred years of their own history, is hardcoded into the stock phrases and expressions dutifully reiterated from one text to another. It is no small irony that, in order to make it look as though China was stripped of agency by foreigners, the authors themselves employ a language that does precisely that—strips China of agency. Foreign penetration into the country is couched in metaphors of corporeal violence and bondage, of predators and prey. Images of China’s ‘prelapsarian’ magnificence and unrivaled antiquity are conjured up as a haunting reminder of what the foreigners took away. “Mosts” and “worsts” are bandied about liberally to give the impression that China suffered unlike any other nation before or since. Foreigners are characterized, with no small measure of acerbity, as something vile from beyond the pale of civilization (yet at the same time regarded as the model, and the condition, for China’s entrance into modernity). When carried to extremes, this results in simple-minded harangues that pin all of China’s woes on the West, and indulge in pains-taking calculations of murdered compatriots, severed territories, unjust reparations, and stolen riches, all the while hurling self-righteous invective at foreign “devils” and “ban-dits.”159
	But is this necessarily wrong? Did China not, in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, fall victim to the expansionist ambitions of Western and Japanese imperialism? The various wars and invasions, as well as the attendant treaties and atrocities—and the toll it all took on the Chinese—are by no means a figment of the authors’ imagination. As Lydia Liu shows, prior to and during the Opium Wars, European colonialists regularly perpetrated mindless acts of cruelty against the native population (the resulting anger and resentment was written off as ‘Chinese xenophobia’ by the British to protect their fragile self-image as Victorian gentlemen).160 Such violence only escalated in the course of the ‘Century’: as Cohen details, when the Eight-Nation Alliance in 1900 occupied Beijing and Tianjin, foreign soldiers arbitrarily terrorized, slaughtered, and raped Chinese civilians, such that dead bodies “were piled high along the roadways,” left “to be eaten by wild dogs and pigs.”161 Worse still were the Japanese war crimes that, even if not quite “the worst in all of history” as the authors insist, nonetheless are unspeakable by any standard.162 And what of the economic and diplomatic coercion? Many of the treaties now referred to as ‘unequal,’ though made in the name of international law, hold its principles up to ridicule: they were aimed less at bringing China into the ‘family of nations,’ than at bringing China to heel.163 This bitter historical experience of the one-sided application of international law—that Western powers forced China to accept their rules, yet refused to play by those rules themselves—goes a long way in explaining the “deep sense of injustice, or fear of injus-tice in a world of power politics,” that still shapes Chinese perceptions of the world to-day.164
	There is no question about it: the authors do have every reason to condemn and exco-riate imperialism. But still, was it as bad as they claim? Were foreigners alone responsible for Chinese suffering? No doubt, countless Chinese were murdered by imperialists, which is a tragedy and a disgrace. But what of the countless Chinese who, during that same period, died by each other’s hands? Apparently these deaths—tens and tens of millions of violent deaths—are, in the authors’ judgment, so meaningless as not to merit even passing mention. And then there is the insistence that the foreign presence was thoroughly deleteri-ous; was death truly the only thing the foreigners dealt in, as the authors lead us to believe? Hardly not. Here, treaty ports are a case in point. The treaty cities running from Canton through Shanghai to Tianjin, if anything, were dynamic loci of economic activity, where ordinary, hard-working Chinese developed booming businesses in symbiosis with Western partners, and enjoyed the kind of cosmopolitan, middle-class lifestyle that would not be seen again in the country for decades.165 Yet the authors dismiss all of this, and claim instead that the treaty ports were “strongholds of aggression”—like “malignant tumors eating away at the Chinese geobody.”166 The hundreds of thousands of Chinese who pros-pered under foreign rule, like the tens of millions of Chinese who perished under Chinese rule, apparently were so insignificant that they might as well be forgotten. This is not to suggest that imperialism was not bad. Rather, it is to point out that by playing up Chinese victimhood, the authors oversimplify and exaggerate its impact. This results not in out-and-out falsification, but in a misplaced emphasis: like crying over a burglary when the house is on fire. Since in reality there was little to choose between foreign and Chinese violence, a fair history would account for both. But the authors consciously disregard one half of the picture, if only to use the other half as ‘proof’ of China’s moral superiority and entitlement. Thus, in the hands of the ‘Century’ authors, modern Chinese history, for all its richness and complexity, becomes just a catalog of unsettled scores and grievances.
	It would be opportune at this point to recall Cohen’s definition of ‘myth,’ and draw the conclusion which naturally follows from the foregoing discussion. However, we will not do so quite yet—as was mentioned earlier, the ‘Century’ tells three stories in one, so for the sake of convenience, we will return to this only after we have unwrapped all three. In the next two sections, we will examine the lesser narratives (let us think of them as ‘sub-plots’) of corruption and resistance. Oddly enough, they do not fit in too well with the main narrative of victimization. In fact, as we shall see in a moment, they in some respects pull in exactly the opposite direction.
3.2   Corruption
For all the bile flung at “imperialist gangsters,” one might get the impression that the au-thors lay the blame squarely on foreign shoulders. Yet this is not so. Yes, it was foreigners who brought China down to her knees, put her in fetters, carved her up like a baby lamb, sucked the marrow out of her bones, and all that—but who was it that let the wolf into the pen in the first place? This co-culprit is a more domestic breed: he is to be found in the ministries and chanceries, in court and councils, on the imperial throne. The following observation by Julia Lovell is very pertinent in this respect:
“In the Chinese narrative of the Opium War, you might expect the line between heroes and villains to be a clear one: honourably resisting servants of the Chinese empire on the one hand, wicked British on the other. The curious thing, though, is how much of the ven-om in the Chinese version of these events has been reserved for characters on their own side: and in particular, for the perceived corruption, indecision and incompetence of the Qing court. For much of the past century and a half, the Chinese have been more inclined to blame their then-rulers than the British for what went wrong.”167
	Lovell mentions the Opium War only, but, as we shall see, her argument rings true for the rest of the ‘Century’ as well. In this section, we turn our attention to this domestic sub-plot, wherein China’s downfall is attributed to the corruption and meekness of past rulers. Whether writing of the Manchu Qing or the warlords and Republicans that came after, the authors cast them in an overwhelmingly negative light as ‘reactionary’ weaklings who, by their inaction and inability—complicity, even—laid the country wide open to the depreda-tions of foreign foes. Essentially, what the authors suggest here is that, even as foreigners were the direct agent of China’s suffering, much of that suffering might have been spared if not for these false shepherds.
3.2.1   Feudalism
The story of corrupt rulers begins on an ominous note, with a ‘backward’ and isolated China set in counterpoint to the ‘advanced,’ expansionist West. The authors unanimously assert that, since the eighteenth century or so, China “had failed to keep abreast of the times”; and, even more importantly, that it had failed to do so for no other reason than the “corruption and incompetence” of the Qing rulers—their “feudal decadence,” their “blind conceit,” their “bull-headed closed-door policy.”168 While the West, with the Industrial Revolution at full tilt, was making vast technological and military strides, the Manchu no-bility were “reveling in their own excellence” behind barred doors, apathetic and oblivious to the world beyond their narrow confines.169 “Proud and vain as peacocks,” one author reproves, “they thought that the ‘Celestial Empire’ neither should, nor could be bothered to learn about the outside world.”170 “The Qing dynasty clung to the delusion that they were the ‘Middle Kingdom,’” another reflects, “when they, in fact, had fallen far behind the West in every respect: politically, economically, militarily, culturally, technologically.”171 As the empire walled itself off from the world, it “missed out on every opportunity for so-cial transition and development” and, unbeknownst to the self-complacent Manchus, “fell from the top to the very bottom.” Thus, the authors reason, it was a “foregone conclusion” that China would in the nineteenth century knuckle under to the industrialized West.172
	On the eve of the ‘Century’—the authors declare in chorus—the empire had reached the last stages of its disease, the principal symptom of which was extreme malfeasance. “The feudal social order that had lasted for well over two millennia was now in melt-down,” notes one author, “the spendthrift Qing court indulged in every extravagance, and officials at all levels engaged in graft and larceny.”173 “The rot had set in deep,” echoes another, “the government was infested through and through with light-fingered mandarins who, devoid of conscience and morality, shunned no means to feather their own nests . . . They sucked up the fruits of the people’s labor, bled the nation’s coffers dry, and let the army wither away.”174 Not unlike these venal bureaucrats, the once fierce and valiant Ban-nermen had also become a “class of parasites”: having “laid aside their arms” and “yielded to luxury and comfort,” the Eight Banners’ “martial spirit of yesteryear gave way to effete pretension,” turning them into “unfit, undisciplined rabble.”175 Most soldiers were addicts, “their rifles eat up with rust, yet their opium pipes polished to a shine.” Commanding officers were no better: on the one hand, there were the emperor’s “playboy nephews” who knew much less about warfare than they did about “eating, drinking, gambling, and whoring”; on the other, “senile old crocks” who “mistook Britain’s superior firepower for witchcraft,” and “sought to break their magic by having human feces dispersed over the front lines.”176
	Basically, what the authors suggest is that, by the time foreign imperialists first set their sights on China, the age-old empire was already in its death throes. Locked away be-hind China’s tightly closed gates, one author summarizes, there was a self-serving manda-rinate that “stripped the common man of everything he had”; a tortured people that “toiled day and night yet could barely scrape by”; a ramshackle army that “whiled away the days at the opera, the mahjong parlor, the whorehouse, and the opium den”; and a “vehemently xenophobic” Manchu court “whose benightedness and backwardness reached ridiculous heights.”177 If even half of this is true, then it is small wonder that China toppled over like a house of cards when British gunboats opened fire.
3.2.2   Incorrigibility
But never mind the defeat by Britain. The Qing rulers may perhaps be excused for their failure in the Opium Wars—after all, they could not have known better at the time. What truly irks the authors, however, is that the they refused to learn from their failure, and would keep on repeating the same mistakes, over and over, with disastrous consequences. True, the authors concede, the British onslaught did shake the Qing elite out of their com-placency—but only for a while. During this brief spell of insecurity, reformists within the court managed to push for military and technological modernization that, admittedly, did yield some gratifying results. Most notably, by the late 1880s, the empire had assembled a modern Western-style fleet: the imposing Beiyang, “the goliath of Asia,” keenly paraded to and fro under the envious eyes of China’s neighbors.178 Yet it was precisely due to such apparent successes, the authors lament, that the Qing nobility relapsed back into their an-cient folly. “The nation lost their heads over the dynasty’s so-called comeback,” one author chides, “and were once again blinded by smug self-satisfaction.”179 Even as the Qing court had somewhat changed their tune with respect to Western powers, no longer lumping them under the condescending label of ‘barbarians,’ they still treated neighboring countries as if they were vassals, expecting them to bow down and pay tribute like in the old days. Their disdain for the Japanese, in particular, was soon to prove fatal. “Official communications [on Japan] were fraught with phrases such as ‘puny statelet,’ ‘savage land,’ ‘insubordina-tion to Our Supremacy,’” one author enumerates mockingly, “‘island barbarians’ here, ‘dwarf pirates’ there, how dare they ‘rebel against their superiors,’ see to that ‘Tokyo is trodden to the ground’—an utter load of rot.”180 Imagine the shock, then, when in 1894 the “great and magnificent” China, for all its new Western warships and firearms, was thrashed by none other than this “puny statelet.”181
	A shock at the time, perhaps—but certainly no surprise in hindsight. Defeat by Japan, the authors argue, was “but a logical continuation of the historical drama” that had been playing out since the Opium Wars.182 Although the Manchus had taken steps in the right direction by embracing Western technology, they remained as oblivious as ever to the feu-dal blight—corruption, inability, Sinocentric hubris—that was eating the empire from the inside out. At the outset of the war with Japan, the Qing army was lolling idly in the lap of luxury, as always, and the command was still entrusted to “Confucian eggheads who had not a clue about military affairs,” princelings “who only excelled in wheeling, dealing, and taking bribes,” and “old farts who entertained themselves with painting and calligraphy.”183 Business as usual. The authors’ point here is that, no matter how modern and capable the ships and guns, they were worthless in the hands of this wretched bunch; to ram home the point, their tragicomic wartime exploits, both on land and at sea, are revisited in vivid de-tail. When the Beiyang fleet was being torpedoed by the Japanese, many Chinese vessels were tossing rudderless, the crews “scurrying around helter-skelter”—their captains, so the story goes, had stayed ashore to “go whoring.” When the Japanese were closing in on the Qing troops in Korea, the generals, “instead of calling a staff meeting to discuss strategy,” went to a roadside temple to “toy with antiques.”184 Most of these generals, we are told, had a severe case of the cold feet. On hearing of the enemy’s approach, they threw down their arms and fled like hares before hounds. Then, having run as far inland as their legs could carry them, they misinformed the emperor of great victories—and were handsomely rewarded for their imaginary feats.185 After Qing forces had been trounced on every front, to top off the fiasco, viceroy (cum-hated-traitor) Li Hongzhang utterly mishandled the peace negotiations at Shimonoseki, capitulating to every shameless demand, “bending the knee,” and “bowing and scraping like a slave” before the Japanese.186 “A servant dancing to his master’s tune,” sighs one author, “how nauseating.”187
	This last part is especially galling: an emissary of the “great and magnificent” Chinese empire pleading and groveling at the feet of a “puny vassal.” Indeed, if we are to take the authors’ word that the Qing dynasty was rotten beyond repair, then what could better sup-port the argument than this “nauseating” scene? It was not long ago, the authors remind, that China and Japan were in the same desperate state—“feudal, backward, under invasion by Western capitalist powers”—yet now one was completely at the mercy of the other. “Both countries had the same opportunity,” one author explains, “Japan, with the Meiji Restoration, seized that opportunity, embarked on the path of capitalist development, and took its place among the world powers.” As for China, that opportunity was all but wasted on “the impenetrable stupidity and degeneracy of the feudal ruling class.”188 Here, a note of grudging admiration creeps in: Japan was endowed with only a fraction of the resources available to China, yet it succeeded wherever China failed, leaping from feudalism to modernity in just one generation, and becoming the first “Western country in the East.”189 From the authors’ point of view, there hardly could be a more bitter demonstration of the fate that, by all odds, should have been China’s.
3.2.3   Personification
Much of the story revolves around famous historical characters, usually depicted as pathet-ic and despicable stooges. We have discussed in passing the craven generals and admirals who took to their heels at the first sign of trouble, the disloyal bureaucrats and diplomats who robbed the country blind, the hedonistic lordlings who had a mind only for concu-bines and opium, and so on. Clearly, in the authors’ hands, these characters are made to personify the Qing rulers’ alleged rottenness. In this regard, few individuals stand out as prominently as Empress Dowager Cixi. Tales of her vanity and venality abound, and may be worth reiterating here at some length.
	At the height of the First Sino–Japanese War, Cixi made abundantly clear where her priorities lay when she “turned a blind eye to the enemy pressing on the borders,” and directed all her energies instead into holding “an extravagant celebration” for her sixtieth birthday. Civil servants were ordered to “close office and attend the festivities for three days straight,” while protesting ministers were silenced by cryptic threats of “lifelong displeasure.”190 Surely the silver squandered on this fatuity would have been better used on the battlefield—not that Cixi, in the habit of embezzling public funds for her pet projects, would have cared. “Her Imperial Majesty,” one author reproves, “misappropriated funds earmarked for the Navy to pay for the building of her gardens. The sum lavished on the Summer Palace alone would have sufficed to purchase eleven Dingyuans [flagship of the Beiyang fleet].”191 Besides robbing the imperial coffers, we are told, Cixi also served the country—on a platter to the enemy, that is. “Let the foreigners have as much as they like to keep them pleased and happy,” she is often quoted as having said.192 When the Eight-Na-tion relief force in 1900 took the capital, the Empress Dowager, while evacuating to Xi’an with the rest of the court, forthwith began “currying favor” with the powers by ostenta-tiously “ordering the Qing army to exterminate the Boxers.”193 Then, when news reached Cixi that the powers would not hold her responsible for the Boxer escapade, “overjoyed,” she acceded to all their demands “without reservation.”194 Let us recall the authors’ ap-praisal of the Boxer Protocol as “unprecedentedly humiliating,” “enslaving,” “worst in history.” Cixi, by contrast, considered the terms so generous that she, reputedly, “shed tears of gratitude”—is this not, one author exclaims, “the very face of the Qing govern-ment’s servility and submission?”195 “The present treaty,” Her Majesty allegedly opined, “neither infringes on our sovereignty nor carves away our lands. We shall remember the powers’ magnanimity, and abhor our own cruelty and ignorance.”196 After the conflict, as if she had not already done enough to disgrace the nation, Cixi had a memorial gate erected for Ketteler, a German plenipotentiary whose “hands were stained with the blood of the Chinese people,” so as to express regrets for his being killed during the revolt. “This,” one author gasps, “was pushing shamelessness to the extreme.”197
3.2.4   Succession
With scenes such those above, the authors lead us to believe that, come the twentieth cen-tury, the Manchu Qing were slaves to every imperialist nation. They signed whatever atro-cious treaty was thrust before them; they prostrated themselves before former tributaries; they even built monuments for foreign murderers. “This was the end of the line,” one author notes, “the intolerable system of absolute monarchy would have to be swept away by revolution . . . only then could China avoid the tragedy of national subjugation.”198 Sure enough, this is just what happened in 1911. However, although the empire was “swept away,” its defects were not: the new states that arose from the wreckage of the empire, in the authors’ judgment, turned out no less corrupt and ‘backward.’ “Xinhai Revolution rid the country of an emperor,” remarks one author, “but it worked no change at all on the deep-rooted institution of feudalism.”199
	So, moving on to the Republican era, we are treated again to airy assertions about all manner of misgovernment. First there were the warlords who “financed their armies with foreign loans, and waged turf wars with one another.” Then came the Nationalists who “licked the dust before foreigners,” and “surrendered Manchuria to the Japanese without firing a single shot.” “Could such power holders,” one author asks rhetorically, “be count-ed on to cleanse national humiliation?”200 Purportedly, the Nationalists could have easily reclaimed Hong Kong and Macau on a number of occasions, yet they chose not to do so—the witch hunt against Communists was far too important to be sidetracked by such trivial-ities.201 While the Japanese were laying waste to much of the country and the Nationalist armies were being routed on all fronts, even then Chiang Kai-shek’s “despotic,” “fascist” regime focused its resources on “purging dissent” and “taxing people to the hilt,” instead of uniting and mobilizing the nation against the real enemy.202 No doubt, these new kings were no better than the Manchus—how else could “tiny Japan” have followed through with the invasion of “vast China?”203 Alas, goes the conclusion to it all, every regime in the long line from Qing through warlords to Nationalists was but a “running dog of imperial-ism.”204
*   *   *
In this section, we have examined a less conspicuous side of the ‘Century,’ where the au-thors look inward for culprits, instead of single-mindedly blaming foreigners. The fascinat-ing thing about this subplot is that it runs counter to everything we have discussed so far, from the overriding emphasis on foreign misdeeds to the portrayal of China as a bound-up victim: now the spotlight is on domestic abuses of power, and China has a role in shaping the course of events (even if by inaction). What the authors are, in effect, saying is that the ‘Century’ was not so much “imposed” on China from without, as brought on China by herself—or, rather, by her unworthy rulers. From this perspective, the ‘Century,’ besides a crisis of foreign invasion, is also, and perhaps more fundamentally so, a crisis of leader-ship. It was none other than the Manchu Qing, we are now told, who by their inability threw China into decline, long before the first shots of the Opium War. Their incompe-tence was one thing, but worse still was their incorrigibility: no humiliation was great enough to jolt them out of their fool’s paradise. That Japan successfully caught up to the West in a mere three decades attests all the more to the Qing court’s ineptitude: just like their Meiji counterpart, they had every chance to put their country back on track, yet con-sistently failed to do so. So deeply entrenched was the feudal plague, that even the new leaders who deposed the dynasty could not break with the past, but inherited their prede-cessors’ “policy of putting down the people and bowing down to foreigners.”205
	Again, all of this is, more or less, grounded in historical reality. For example, let us consider the Qing dynasty’s well-documented shortcomings in the Opium Wars. Late-Qing military was seriously hamstrung by outdated and defective equipment, a general lack of discipline and organization, and regional fragmentation that often led to mutinies. Bannermen had succumbed to a life of leisure (singing arias, flying kites, tending fish; that kind of thing), retaining only a shadow of their former prowess.206 Therefore, even with their considerable numerical advantage, Qing forces were repeatedly worsted by the grue-somely efficient British armies: the battles ended almost as soon as they begun in heavy casualties and a complete collapse of morale on the Chinese side.207 And while the Qing armies were being blown sky-high by British cannon, the emperor’s loyal underlings—for fear of losing their heads—systematically fabricated reports about improbably impressive victories. Deluged with misinformation, the emperor remained blissfully unaware of the Brits’ intentions and demands throughout the conflict.208 We should see much similarity to the depiction in the ‘Century’ writings. Even the colorful tales of the harebrained exploits of this or that senile general or playboy princeling, it appears, are in line with historical fact. For instance, one of the emperor’s nephews, Yijing, rather than confront the foreign-ers he was appointed to ‘annihilate,’ preferred to stay back in Suzhou at a safe remove from any troubles, enjoying the leisurely town’s delights from calligraphy to concubines. For another, one stone-deaf septuagenarian general, Yang Fang, demonstrated his military acumen by trying to counter the Westerners’ ‘dark arts’ with women’s chamber-pots.209
	The problem here is not fabrication. Rather, it is the same as with the story of victimi-zation: that is, (mis)taking a part for the whole. Or, in Cohen’s words, “wrenching from the past single characteristics or traits or patterns that are then portrayed as the essence of past reality.”210 The authors see only the worst in the Manchus, ‘warlords,’ and Nationalists, reducing what should be a rich history of statecraft to a monolithic history of maladminis-tration. What of, for just one example, the Beiyang government’s professional, pragmatic, and efficient handling of foreign affairs, and its impressive legal struggles against the ‘un-equal treaties’?211 There is a great irony here that must be pointed out: the authors’ under-standing of late Qing China is, in fact, not their own, but a product of European Sinopho-bia. It has its roots in Enlightenment thinkers who dreamed up a despotic ‘Orient’ as a counterbalance to the virtues of liberalism. There was in Asia, the Montesquieus and Humes preached, a cruel, hermetic state that exercised absolute, arbitrary power over a slave people (unlike liberal Europe, mind you).212 This unflattering view, which had little to do with reality, was later drawn on by British warmongers in enlisting popular support for the Opium War. Their take on China was even less real: “an evil empire fossilized into an ancient superiority complex,” as Lovell puts it, “that refused to play by the rules of the international game so recently invented by Europe.” Later still, this vision of an inert, in-ept, and airtight relic of an empire, that had to be torn out of its ‘Celestial’ delusions by the advanced West, was reproduced by Marx in a few of his anti-imperialist tracts—and it was through Marx’s writings that it entered into Chinese historical thought, and took on an aura of ‘truth.’213 Thus, by depicting pre-Communist China as an archaic Sinocentric abomina-tion in need of a coup de grâce, the Chinese authors perpetuate a profoundly Eurocentric misinterpretation.
	One final note before moving on. The authors do not denounce China’s past rulers so scathingly just out veneration for Marx. Nor just out of spite. A crucial implication of viewing the ‘Century’ as a crisis of leadership is that the solution lies in the hands of the Chinese themselves. Satisfying as it may be to pin the blame solely on the West, doing so would imply that the cause of China’s plight is ‘out there,’ thus leaving the Chinese relatively powerless to turn the situation around. Whereas, if the issue is within, it may be much more readily diagnosed and redressed—it is then the Chinese who hold the key to the nation’s future.214 Indeed, the ‘Century’ does not end with a sudden pang of conscience sweeping through the imperialist camp, whereupon foreign powers give up all their privi-leges and concessions in China, and ruefully leave for home to reflect on their crimes. It ends only when the Chinese replace their ineligible leaders with an appropriate one, there-by removing the root cause that made their humiliation possible in the first place. (There, of course, is a powerful political message embedded herein, but more on that later.)
3.3   Resistance
Thus it is conceded that the ‘Century,’ after all, was not an entirely exogenous affair. Yet this does not take us very far in the direction of a deeper and more involved understanding. Quite to the contrary, it results in little more than yet another moral dichotomy (like the one between Chinese victims and foreign bullies). Rather than deal with the ambiguities of reality, the authors point the finger at a single factor—misrule—as the cause of everything that was wrong with China. And if the rulers alone were at fault, then it is no stretch to ascribe virtue solely to their counterpart—the people. This is spelled out explicitly in the writings:
“Contrary to the traitorous, defeatist Qing government, the Chinese people (including some military officers and scholar-officials) gave the noblest expression to the spirit of patriotism, and made the ultimate sacrifice.”215
“Cowering under the powers’ intimidation, the feeble and corrupt Qing government lost their footing, and gave ground step by step . . . the Chinese people, ever more so, greeted the invaders with firm resistance.”216
	To be sure, whenever a Chinese figure is depicted fouling up, fleeing in panic, grovel-ing before foreigners, or otherwise “selling out the nation,” they invariably hail from the ranks of the government. With such disappointingly bad rulers, it was then for the people to live up to the standards and ideals for which the nation stands. This opens up a second subplot, in which ordinary Chinese step into the breach where their leaders have failed and, hopeless as it may have been, stand up to the foreign invaders. To complete the pic-ture, we will still need to examine this story of the people’s resistance.
3.3.1   Victims or heroes?
It was demonstrated earlier that the ‘Century’ very much rests on the notion of Chinese victimhood. We are told, account after account, how the Chinese people, literally, and the Chinese nation, figuratively, were trodden underfoot, put in chains, “brought down like lambs to the slaughter,” and so on. It is therefore perplexing that the better part of these accounts, in the same breath, go on to tell us how the Chinese people “did not bend the knee,” but “boldly fought to the bitter end,” “not daunted in the least by the vicious foreign bandits.”217 The result is confusing, to say the least. At one moment, the Chinese are para-lyzed victims, “cut up like cattle”; at the next, fearless freedom fighters who “delivered a crushing blow against Western capitalist-imperialist forces.”218 In one paragraph, foreign-ers rape and plunder with abandon, leaving nothing but death and devastation in their wake; in the next, they recoil in fear, having everywhere “met with staunch resistance from patriotic braves.”219 How possibly could the Chinese be at once both victims and he-roes? Why would the authors so forcefully push the idea of victimization on the one hand, only to negate it on the other?
	Absurd though this may seem, it would be short-sighted of us to dismiss the notion out of hand. On a closer look, the twin role of ‘victim–hero’ is not as oxymoronic as one might at first think. In fact, the authors quite persuasively weave the two together. Again, the writings speak for themselves:
“Where there is oppression, there must be resistance; the harder the oppression, the fiercer the resistance. The barbaric incursions and cut-throat bullying of imperialism, aside from inflicting unprecedented suffering and humiliation on the Chinese race, also served as a dramatic wake-up call for the Chinese to rise and fight, compelling them to wage a long and bitter struggle against the invaders and their minions in China.”220
“China’s modern history, on the one hand, records how imperialists, in partnership with feudal forces, caused China to degenerate into a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, thereby plunging the Chinese people into an abyss of misery, misfortune, and bitter tears of blood. On the other, it records the Chinese people’s outstanding achievements in the tenacious and indomitable struggle to save the nation from subjugation.”221
“Modern Chinese history, besides a history of how our homeland was bullied and humili-ated by the powers, is also a history of how the Chinese people stood up to foreign aggres-sion, and fought for liberation and independence. From the mid-nineteenth century on-ward, countless revolutionary martyrs, men of high ideals, and common people took part in the struggle against imperialist oppression. Valiantly they laid down their lives; where one fell, another would instantly take their place.”222
	Indeed, victimization need not rule out the possibility that the Chinese, before being overpowered and brought to heel, would have put up a fight; or that they, even after being conquered, would have occasionally tried to turn the tables on their adversaries. The stories of victimhood and heroism, though an odd combination, may coexist so long as we do not limit our thinking to strictly boolean terms. As the quotes above show, there is the sense that one led to the other, as though imperialist violence was a “wake-up call” for a dormant nation. Foreign guns blasted China (and a great many Chinese) to pieces; yet at the same time, as one author so poetically puts it, “the boom of cannon roused thousands upon thousands of lions from slumber.”223 Western barbarians maimed and mutilated the motherland, to the soundtrack of their victims’ lamentation; still, “when one opens the pages of China’s modern history,” beneath the weep and wail, “it is as though one could hear the sons and daughters of China raise an unyielding battle cry against oppression.”224
3.3.2   Exemplars
This story of ‘waking lions,’ much like that of corrupt rulers, is inseparable from an en-semble of historical figures. A good number of “revolutionary martyrs” and “men of high ideals,” who in one way or another demonstrated their heroic credentials—more often than not, fighting to the last breath in losing battles, or committing suicide to avoid disgrace—are singled out and put on a pedestal as patriotic exemplars.225 The peculiar thing, though, is that this pantheon of heroes is mostly populated by civil servants and military officers, who served just those ‘corrupt’ and ‘backward’ regimes that the authors never tire of lambasting. Nonetheless, here they are counted among the ‘people,’ as if their exceptional deeds somehow severed their connection with the government. If a servant of the state does the right thing, goes the subtext, surely their loyalties lie not with the state but with the people.
	A few examples of such celebrated individuals may be in order. Foremost, of course, is commissioner Lin Zexu, the archetype of “a great patriot,” “an embodiment of the Chi-nese people’s self-respect and confidence,” “the first among the feudal officialdom to open his eyes to the world.” And his feat? He was the one who, “unintimidated by the British,” clamped down on the opium smuggling in Canton and, “with great fanfare,” committed the drug to the flames at Humen. In so doing, he “opened the first page in the century-long history of the Chinese people’s glorious struggle against aggression, showing the whole world the Chinese people’s pure and noble morality and determination to resist foreign invasion.” As the British poison went up in billows of smoke, “the people applauded and rejoiced, while foreign opium traffickers exchanged fearful glances.” Again, the story would not be complete without a thumbs-up, real or imaginary, from a Western spectator: “upright foreigners expressed deep admiration for Lin Zexu’s incorruptibility and breadth of vision.”226
	Another such character is Deng Shichang, one of the more illustrious (or, less notori-ous) captains of the Beiyang fleet, who “met death unflinchingly” in the 1894 battle of the Yellow Sea. When the hull of his ship, the Zhiyuan, was breached, he “realized that the time had come to die for his country,” whereupon he “ordered full steam and open throt-tle,” and set the vessel on a collision course with the Japanese cruiser Yoshino. Under his inspiring leadership, the whole crew “prepared to take their enemies with them to a watery grave, without a hint of fear on their faces, their eyes ablaze with hatred.” “A deafening roar split the air: ‘Ram the Yoshino! Ram the Yoshino!’” Sadly, this brave effort fell flat as the Zhiyuan, “just when about to collide,” was sunk by the enemy, and “the crew, one by one, were washed overboard.” So determined Deng was to give his life for the country, the story goes, that he “hurled aside the life buoy” thrown to him. Finally, in a poignant ex-pression of loyalty, “Deng’s pet dog paddled over to him, and grabbed hold of his queue,” as if trying to rescue its master. Even this did not shake Deng’s resolve, however: “he pushed the dog underwater and, with hatred and resignation, let himself drown.”227 This is quite a contrast to the lesser captains who lost their nerve and abandoned formation, or, as we may remember from the previous section, preferred the brothel over battle. Even the Japanese who witnessed the spectacle, we are told, were smitten with reverence.
3.3.3   People
The list of virtuous statesmen, who gave such stirring displays of courage, is a long one. But, as was noted above, when the authors write about the ‘actual’ people, similar champi-ons and exploits are in disturbingly short supply. Thus, rather than as individuals, the people are invoked in the plural and the abstract. In the typical scenario, bullied peasants, bubbling over with wrath, band together in formidable numbers for a show of righteous violence. Let us, once again, illustrate with examples. The first, and perhaps the most em-blematic instance of such outbursts of collective fury is that of Sanyuanli (a village some-where in the Canton region). When the British in the First Opium War invaded Canton, they “harassed villages, stole cattle, damaged crops, desecrated ancestral graves, and raped women”—to which the locals, understandably, did not take kindly.228 In response, infuriat-ed peasants throughout the region came together by the thousands on their own accord, and “sounded the first bugle in the Chinese people’s spontaneous struggle against external aggression.” “We are not worthy men,” the torch-and-pitchfork brigade thundered, “unless we slaughter these pigs and mutts down to the last one.”229 And, according to story, they more or less did just that: they “inflicted massive losses on the British, pounding them until they kneeled and begged for mercy,” teaching them the hard way that “the Chinese people cannot be insulted, nor bullied into submission.”230 With this “heroic feat,” the villagers of Sanyuanli set a “shining example” that would be followed by many others.231 Next in line were the Taipings who, as we learned some pages back, likewise “stood un-daunted in the face of foreign aggressors,” and struck one or two “heavy blows” at them. Then there were the Boxers who “raised high the banner ‘Obliterate the foreigners!’” and, armed with little but pikes and blades, bravely threw themselves at the imperialists’ rifles and cannon “in a display of the highest patriotic zeal and devotion.” Even though they were crushed, the Boxers still “struck extraordinary terror into the invading armies,” and hammered home the lesson that “the Chinese people cannot be humiliated.” So unnerved were the foreigners by such “indomitable resistance,” we are told, that they effectively “abandoned their plans to carve up China.”232
	Yet nowhere did the spirit of resistance find fuller expression than in the lost territo-ries. When Japanese forces in 1895 landed on Taiwan to assume control over their new colony, spineless Qing bureaucrats and generals, as usual, were the first to turn tail. The Taiwanese people, by contrast, “at once launched an intense guerilla war to defend the homeland and drive out the invaders,” the scale of which “took the Japanese command completely by surprise.”233 “The Japanese aggressors that once thrashed the Qing armies,” applauds one author, “were now, in turn, bloodied by the Taiwanese.”234 Despite never quite managing to overturn Japan’s “reign of cruelty,” the embattled Taiwanese, “deterred by no sacrifice,” nonetheless kept up the fight as long as the enemy set foot on the island, and thereby “wrote a glorious chapter in the history of the Chinese people’s struggle against foreign aggression.”235 The compatriots in Hong Kong were no less intrepid: ever since the British took over in 1842, so we are told, the people never gave up the attempt to “recapture” the island. Hong Kongers covertly destroyed foreign wares, sabotaged food supplies, and spied for the mainland—quite fantastically—all the while “making prepara-tions to burn ships and kill enemies.” They organized massive strikes and boycotts, during which “trade and transport were cut off, factories ground to a halt, shops closed their doors, and cars laid idle, such that the ‘Fragrant Harbor’ turned into a ‘dead, stinking harbor.’” The British colonialists were given such a hard time, one author sneers, that they were “on tenterhooks all day, every day.”236 In terms of duration, the Taiwanese and Hong Kongers (with 50 and 155 years of resistance under their belts, respectively) are topped only by the Macanese, who defied their conquerors for well over four hundred years. “From the very first day of Portugal’s illegal occupation of Macau,” vaunts one author, “the Chinese people did not even once desist from the struggle to reclaim the island.”237 Another author elatedly recounts the gruesome fate of one Portuguese colonial governor, a “despotic one-armed general” and an “infamous pirate of the blackest dye,” who had en-raged the local populace by despoiling their ancestors’ graves and “casting the bones into the sea.” One day, when riding around the countryside, he was ambushed by a group of villagers who knocked him off his horse and “lopped off both his head and the one remain-ing arm.” With this “gallant feat,” the conclusion goes, “they composed a sonnet that moves the heaven and shakes the earth.”238
3.3.4   Victory in defeat
According to the authors, many such “glorious chapters” and “earth-shaking sonnets” were written and composed throughout the ‘Century’ by shedding foreign blood. Still, these valiant struggles fell short of stopping the onslaught of imperialism. But this is beside the point; what matters is that the people proved their mettle. “Unintimidated,” they went up against an unbeatable enemy, willing to “fight to the bitter end” and to “face death with a smile.” Apparently, in the authors’ imagination, this sacrificial spirit allows the nation a kind of symbolic victory, in spite of its material defeat. Though the people “could not keep China from sliding into the depths of semi-colonialism,” as one author puts it, “they gave expression to the undying patriotic national spirit that the superior sons and daughters of the Chinese race have forged with their lives and blood.” And here comes the important part: “confronted with such a spirit, the invaders trembled.”239 As usual, the authors’ assertions find validation in foreign reactions. The image of the Chinese hero is routinely accompanied by that of pathetic, awe-struck Westerners, their teeth clattering and knees shaking at the sight of such a spiritually formidable opponent.
	But if the Chinese were so indomitable, why were they defeated time and time again? Here, we run again into the notion that the ‘Century’ was a crisis of leadership. The people certainly had potential, the authors mean to imply, but they lacked organization and direc-tion. And in lieu of a proper leader, that could put forth a proper “theory for national salva-tion,” all the people’s efforts were bound to be in vain.240 Indeed, it was only in the ‘War of Resistance’ that this fundamental issue was finally resolved. Communists in the vanguard, the Chinese people “with their flesh and bone built a steel Great Wall for the defense of the homeland,” and “with their heroic spirit, that could move mountains and rivers, composed an epic that could stun heaven and earth, and make even gods weep”241—the ‘Century’ then ends in a resounding victory. But again we venture into political waters, which is best left for later.
*   *   *
In this section, we have taken a look at the curious subplot of resistance, wherein the roles of the wolf and the sheep are momentarily turned upside down. The curious thing is not the story in and of itself, but the fact that it is presented cheek by jowl with the main narra-tive of victimization, which for all practical purposes is its very antithesis. As a result, the Chinese are portrayed simultaneously as passive victims at the mercy of imperialist marauders, and as intrepid resistance fighters who would rather die than submit. In like manner, foreigners are depicted running roughshod over the Chinese, yet at once shivering in awe of their imposing presence. This, however, is not much of an issue. Though they certainly detract from one another, the twin roles need not necessarily cancel each other out. As we have seen, the authors do have ways to navigate a balance between the two seemingly contradictory images: they are “opposite, yet complementary,” as one author puts it.242 Foreigners smashed the country, but could not break its spirit.
	The real issue (which the authors do not even begin to address) is elsewhere. Consid-ering how this is supposed to be a story of the “Chinese people’s glorious struggle against foreign aggression,” it is remarkable how heavily it relies on characters that, arguably, had little to do with the people. Where one would expect an abundance of Lei Feng’ish peasant champions as a counterweight for the cowards and traitors of the government, we find instead another line-up of mandarins and generals. The ‘good guys,’ it turns out, are drawn from exactly the same pool as the ‘bad guys.’ While the evil deeds of one state functionary are regarded as proof of the government’s corruption, somehow the good deeds of another do not count as evidence to the contrary—incredibly enough, in the authors’ view, they at-test to the people’s virtue instead. If a civil servant does bad, they are with the government; but if they do good, they magically change sides and become ‘people.’
	When it comes to the ‘actual’ people (not statesmen turned people’s heroes), the authors seem to have trouble naming any outstanding individuals. Moreover, there is little in the way of such vividly detailed scenes of defiance and sacrifice as we see with the Lin Zexus and Deng Shichangs. Thus, the people appear in their own story as a nameless and faceless abstraction, whose struggles are couched in soaring metaphors, but seldom spelled out with specificity. Be it the Sanyuanli villagers, the Taipings, the Boxers, or whoever else, the accounts recycle the same clichés about “striking fear,” “delivering crushing blows,” teaching foreigners “lessons” about Chinese national/racial characteristics (“the Chinese cannot be insulted,” “cannot be humiliated,” “cannot be bullied,” “cannot be taken lightly”), and all that. The reader is often left wanting for details. How did the battles unfold? What kind of epic feats were witnessed on the battlefield? What exactly did the heroic peasants do that sent foreigners scurrying in terror, and “moved the gods them-selves to tears?” Such questions are rarely answered. A skeptic might be tempted to won-der whether many of these “glorious chapters” really took place at all.
3.4   Conclusion
“Speaking of ‘national humiliation,’ how is it only China?” asks one author. “It is no less a ‘national humiliation’ for those other countries!” he adds—and rightly so.243 In the nine-teenth and early twentieth centuries, many Western powers, along with Japan, were indeed engaged in a scramble for China, and much of what they did there was nothing short of disgraceful. As we have discussed, the authors (their borderline abusive language notwith-standing) are entirely justified in condemning the imperialist activities of the West. Their biting excoriation of the late Qing dynasty and the successive state formations is not with-out foundation either: the former in particular, as we have seen, does have a colorful track record in military, diplomatic, and administrative bungling. And, though we may question whether historical characters can, or should, be divided into the ‘good’ and the ‘bad,’ the various heroes and traitors of whom we are told, as well as the deeds for which they are either praised or vilified, are all very real.
	There, no doubt, is much truth in the stories we have investigated in this chapter. Yet, here they are placed under the header of ‘myth.’ But then again, we never expected them to be fictitious through and through. For a myth to have any persuasive power—for it to pass off as the ‘real deal,’ so to speak—it must maintain a strong semblance of historicity. Recalling Cohen’s analysis, mythologizers do not so much fabricate a story out of thin air, as play fast and loose with the evidence to make it fit a preconceived idea. The mytholo-gizers’ job, in other words, is something of a balancing act: while putting a spin on history, they must take care not to stray so far afield as to reveal their agenda. Thus, myths are “in some sense ‘true’ and ha[ve] genuine links to a genuine historical past,” as Cohen notes. “But, like photographs, which always leave out far more than they include,” he adds, “the kind of truth they convey is fundamentally ahistorical—subjective, one-sided, egregiously incomplete.”244
	Is this not precisely the case with the ‘Century’? Instead of starting out with a blank canvas and trying to paint a balanced and comprehesive picture of the past, it begins with a desired image—China as a victim, foreigners as villains, rulers as traitors, people as heroes—then cherry-picks only the parts which hew to that image, and treats this fragmentary selection as if it were the whole story. Rather than capture the shades of gray that inhere in all human experience, it shows us a monochrome world divided into mutually exclusive binaries: good and evil, right and wrong, civilization and barbarism, patriot and traitor. And when this partial reading is further colored with extreme rhetoric, there are no limits on exaggeration: foreign devils swallowed China whole, and left behind nothing but death and despair; Chinese victims had no say in the fate of their country, and no part in their own suffering; all rulers were afflicted with a feudal dementia that made them slaves to imperialism and enemies to the people; pathetic foreigners were mentally overwhelmed and traumatized by the patriotic spirit of peasant insurgents. Indeed, the ‘Century’ reads like a textbook example of myth.
	But what of the motive? Myths exploit the past for present purposes—so what purpose does the ‘Century’ serve? This becomes rather obvious when we add up the sharp moral distinctions it draws. Basically, as we have seen, there are two major dividing lines, one that separates the good inside from the bad outside (Chinese versus foreigners), and an-other that further divides the inside into the good and the bad (people versus rulers, heroes versus traitors). A complex reality is thus collapsed into a simple framework consisting of good Chinese, evil outsiders, and the latter’s minions in China.245 Then, as we have repeat-ed several times now, historical data which do not fit into this framework are either manip-ulated or suppressed, such that the Chinese ‘people’ appear never to have engaged in the kind of misdemeanor for which the other two are incriminated. Put another way, the insis-tence that only foreigners committed violence displaces Chinese brutality onto outsiders, while the category of corrupt rulers and traitors works as a ‘garbage chute’ for disposing of defective insiders (the “scum of the nation,” as they are often called246). In this way, the Chinese reader, rather than have to reflect on the ambiguities of history, may at all times identify with the ‘righteous,’ be it victim or hero: ‘we’ never did anything bad, and even if someone did, they were not really one of ‘us.’ Clearly, the ‘Century’ responds to national-istic imperatives: it is less concerned with coming to terms with the past, than with occu-pying the moral high ground. As one author elatedly concludes, “it is by the inevitable log-ic of history that, in the end, the just prevail over the wicked”247—as if history itself picked sides and favored the ‘good guys.’ And so, we have returned to where we were at the end of the previous chapter: that the ‘Century’ methodically forgets one part of the past, be-cause it is a morality tale.
4   Politics
In a 1997 article celebrating the retrocession of Hong Kong to China, Yang Gongsu, a re-nowned diplomat, looked back on his student years:
“The word ‘national humiliation’ is relatively alien to young people today. In my youth, however, it was a catchphrase that had people squirming with grief and anger. Back then, we would take to the streets and, afire with righteous wrath, shout at the top of our lungs that we ‘swore to cleanse national humiliation!’ In 1925, when I was only a middle school student, I took part in mass rallies to commemorate May 5th (the day that Japan issued their ultimatum of twenty-one demands), May 9th (a national humiliation day decided up-on collectively by ralliers from all over the country), and May 30th (the day on which the Japanese and the British massacred Chinese workers in Shanghai). We marched in proces-sion through the streets, giving speeches and rousing the masses, yelling slogans like ‘down with British and Japanese imperialism,’ ‘abrogate the unequal treaties,’ and so forth. Though sixty, seventy years have since elapsed, the memory remains as vivid as if it were only yesterday.”248
	The notion of national humiliation, as Yang’s recollection attests, traces back to the early twentieth century. It first grew out of the anxiety of late Qing intellectuals as to whether the Chinese ‘race’ could survive imperialism. Many came to believe that, for Chi-na to be brought so low by the white man (and, even worse, by Japanese ‘dwarf slaves’), there must have been something terribly wrong with the Chinese.249 The problem, they eventually figured out, was one of consciousness: foreign depredations were one thing, but worse was the people’s abominable indifference thereto. No matter how the nation was in-sulted, the common man remained unmoved. So, if China were to be saved from humilia-tion (which, it was feared, would lead to ‘national extinction’), the populace had to be awakened to a sense of collective shame.250
	Foreign-controlled treaty ports, ironically, were an ideal springboard for such consciousness-raising activity: with the commercial press and the budding middle class, there were the means to spread new ideas, and an informed reading public to receive those ideas.251 The humiliation discourse caught on quickly, as nongovernmental urban elites—gentry, businessmen, teachers, returning students—filled journals with articles decrying the evils of imperialism, and set up ‘national humiliation societies’ as fora for fuming over foreign insults. The effects were felt for the first time in May 1915 when, in response to Yuan Shikai’s acceding to the ‘twenty-one demands,’ national humiliation was used as a rallying cry to mobilize public outrage, protests, and boycotts all over the country.252 Clear-ly then, at least in the cities, there was a new awareness of, and concern for the nation’s shameful condition. But alas, critics observed, though the sense of injury was easily ignited, it diminished just as sharply—people ‘forgot’ about humiliation all too soon, and relapsed into apathy. It thus became imperative to jog the public memory. Anniversaries of traumatic events (of which there was no shortage) were commemorated as ‘national hu-miliation days,’ marked by mass rallies and parades; school textbooks chronicled foreign crimes against China, so as to inculcate in children a desire to ‘wipe away’ the humiliation; public space was peppered with behests to ‘never forget national humiliation,’ printed and plastered everywhere from newspapers to advertisements, from towels to cigarette packs, from stationery to memorabilia.253 National humiliation even found its way onto maps, that graphically dotted treaty ports, massacres, and severed territories in bright red like open wounds on a disfigured geobody.254 Occasionally the mnemonic enforcement took a violent turn, when less enthusiastic individuals, labeled as ‘race traitors,’ were dragged through the streets and publicly ridiculed or assaulted, such that they would feel the na-tion’s shame as though it were their own.255
	What we should note here, in particular, is that the creation and dissemination of national humiliation discourse in the early twentieth century had everything to do with an emerging, civic-minded middle class, and nothing to do with the state.256 It was, in other words, born and developed ‘middle-out.’ But it would not remain so: it was too popular to be passed up by political opportunists and, later, too radical to be tolerated by authority. The ‘taming’ of national humiliation began in the mid-1920s, when the uneasy GMD–CCP alliance appropriated the discourse for use in propaganda.257 Then, after the violent rupture between the two parties, and the GMD’s coming to power in 1927, the national humiliation extravaganza was quarantined and turned into a strictly official affair, to be used as a vehicle for instilling loyalty to the new Nationalist government.258 To win over the people’s sympathies, the GMD came to portray itself as the only force that could save the nation from imperialism and warlordism, and thus ‘cleanse national humiliation.’259 Historiography followed suit: it was then, over eight decades into what would later be called the ‘Century of national humiliation,’ that China’s modern past transformed from a complex history of internal strife and civil war into the simple tale about good Chinese and bad foreigners, about humiliation and victimization, that it remains today.260
	This understanding of China’s historical situation, however, was put under wraps after the Communist ‘liberation’ in 1949. From then on, the official historical narrative—the only narrative there was—focused not on China’s disgraceful maltreatment by the West, but on revolution and victory under Mao’s leadership. As the line between friends and foes was redrawn in terms of ‘class’ rather than ‘race-nation,’ there simply was no need to harp on about national humiliation. Apart from ideology, there was also a much more concrete reason for hushing up the ‘Century’: it was in fact the GMD that fought the war against Japan, and negotiated the annulment of most ‘unequal treaties.’ The people were better off not knowing that the ‘glorious and correct’ CCP actually had little, if anything, to do with the triumphs it celebrated as its own. Thus, the humiliating memories that the Chinese had urged each other to ‘never forget,’ were thereafter very purposely forgotten.261

A full-text search for guochi (‘national humiliation’) in the archives of People’s Daily yields intriguing results. From 1949 all the way to 1989 the term crops up scarcely. Then, come 1990s, there is an explosion in frequency. On average, the term appears over nine times more often in the latter period.262 In a similar vein, Callahan reports that “[a]ccording to the records of the National Library of China in Beijing, no national humiliation history textbooks were published between 1937 and 1990,” yet there was a landslide of such books from 1990 onward.263 Evidently, the ‘Century’ was, after a long hiatus, resuscitated at this juncture—and abruptly at that. The fact that this sudden reemergence is observable in the foremost party mouthpiece as well as in history textbooks, both of which are strictly screened for political orthodoxy by the government, suggests no small degree of state involvement. The timing, even more so. Could it be that the reintroduction of national humiliation was a political maneuver, and if so, is there a connection to what happened on Tiananmen Square in 1989?
	Now the reader may gasp, incredulously: ‘Why does it always come down to Beijing Spring?’ Still, the present chapter argues that this, indeed, is the case: that the Communist regime, at the nadir of its legitimacy, breathed new life into the ‘Century’ with an eye on securing a future for itself, after having run over its own people with tanks. Unlikely though this may at first sound, there is a large body of studies that provide compelling evidence precisely to this effect. In this chapter we will, first, present this argument as put forth in the secondary literature; and, second, see whether we can find the CCP’s finger-prints in the writings.
4.1   Communism to nationalism
In the spring of 1989, Chinese students flocked to Tiananmen square by the hundreds of thousands to voice their dissatisfaction with the Communist leadership. It was time, they insisted, for the party to step aside. They famously erected a mock Statue of Liberty across from the giant portrait of Chairman Mao that hangs above Tiananmen gate—an act that, perhaps, tells something of a misplaced trust in the West. Ten years later, in May 1999, another generation of students spilled out onto the streets; their ire, however, was directed elsewhere. Instead of chanting for democracy and replicating American monuments, they besieged US diplomatic missions in all the major cities, barraging the premises with rocks and bricks for days on end while bellowing about “blood debts” and “humiliations.” The 1989 demonstrations were the culmination of a decade of acute domestic tensions, coupled with a strange fetishism with the West. By contrast, the 1999 protests erupted, no less spontaneously, in response to the NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade—which, most Chinese were absolutely convinced, was a premeditated assault, a conspiracy, and an affront to China’s national dignity.264
	After the 1989 crackdown, it was widely believed that the CCP had signed its own death warrant. Many predicted that the party-state would soon collapse along with the rest of the communist bloc, and that ‘history would end’ with the triumph of liberal democracy. Ironically, just the opposite happened. In the following years, Chinese popular attitudes toward the West soured rapidly, and the public seemed to once again rally around the party banner.265 Whenever friction arose between China and the West (the US interception of the Chinese freighter Yinhe, China’s lost bid for the 2000 Olympics, the Taiwan Strait crisis, disqualification of Chinese athletes for doping, the Belgrade embassy bombing, and so on), the Chinese people, both at home and overseas, would echo the state rhetoric of hurt national feelings and anti-China conspiracies. With each successive outburst of popular anti-Western sentiment, it became increasingly evident that not only had the CCP come through the crisis unscathed, more bafflingly still, it now presided over “a very patriotic and supporting populace that many governments would be envious to have.”266 Western analysts, who had anticipated the party’s demise, had a tough puzzle to solve: just how is it that China went, in a mere decade, from the anti-establishment ‘Tank Man’ generation to flag-waving ‘irate youth’?
	Communism had given up the ghost, no doubt; but it turned out that the CCP had found something better as a replacement. On the pages of English-language journals, there soon emerged a consensus that the Communist leadership—let me exaggerate a little here—had used nationalism to brainwash the people into obedience. Much of this early inquiry was informed less by facts than by value judgments: the good Chinese could not possibly have become so suspicious of the West, went the subtext to it all, unless evil communists were whispering in their ear.267 A body of more objective and rigorous scholarship follow-ed, indicating that, though the CCP certainly had done something to this effect, the dynam-ics underlying China’s resurgent nationalism were far more convoluted than that. Indeed, each of these analyses comes to a somewhat different conclusion as to whether Chinese nationalism is state-engineered, or genuine and spontaneous; whether it is best understood as a response to external provocation, or as a reflection of internal developments; whether it conditions, or is conditioned by China’s interaction with the outside world; whether it is a threat to regional, if not global security, or just a lot of hot air; whether it is anything ‘new’ at all; and so on.268 Of course, no single argument captures all of it, but when drawn together and viewed as a whole, this rich literature provides a window into contemporary Chinese nationalism in all its complexity and perplexity. It does not show us an all-power-ful CCP pulling the strings on one fifth of humankind, nor a beleaguered CCP picking fights with the West just to keep the people’s chauvinistic rage from turning against them; neither a ‘yellow peril’ scheming to reestablish Sinocentric hierarchy, nor a ‘happy panda’ turned into an ‘angry dragon’ by the browbeating of loudmouthed American bullies. Rath-er, it reveals a multilateral process of competition, negotiation, and compromise, shaped by the mutual interplay between the party-state and the people, between the outside and the inside, between reason and passion, between past and present—a living construct that de-fies any simple explanations.269
	These intricacies, however, are irrelevant to our discussion. What we need to note here, simply, is that a popular nationalism emerged in China beginning in the 1990s; that this reemergence had a lot, but not everything, to do with the CCP’s ‘identity crisis’; and that, in the process, the discourse of national humiliation was brought back into wide cir-culation. In this section, we will briefly review the ‘communism to nationalism’ argument from a state-centered perspective, to the extent that it explains why the ‘Century’ has once again come to the forefront of public memory.
4.1.1   Crisis
The economic reforms inaugurated by the post-Mao leadership in late 1970s, in spite of establishing China as a true powerhouse in the global economy and dramatically improv-ing the living standards of Chinese people, were not in every respect beneficial to their initiators. The reforms, relying heavily on local initiatives for impetus, required the state to devolve economic decision-making to regional authorities which then, relatively free to pursue local interests at the expense of national ones, began to compete with each other for foreign trade. As coastal provinces were better positioned than those inland to cash in on the ‘open door,’ the benefits were distributed unevenly, resulting in increasing disparity in economic performance between, and growing socioeconomic polarization within provin-ces. Losing control over fiscal revenue, the central government verged on bankruptcy such that many key national institutions from the police to the army, in lieu of state funding, had to involve themselves in local businesses to make ends meet, raising doubts as to where their loyalties lie. Thus reform policies, while indeed the catalyst for China’s phenomenal economic growth, misfired to the extent of weakening the state’s grip over localities and widening inequalities within society, none of which was exactly conducive to securing popular support for the CCP.270
	Apart from such material issues, perhaps even more deleterious to the party-state’s standing were the much less tangible ‘crises of faith’: come 1980s, the Chinese people had all but exhausted their confidence in both the CCP and its official ideology.271 As China opened up, the degree of its underdevelopment was exposed, pulverizing whatever vestige of faith in communism might have spilled over through the decades of Mao’s misrule. Dis-enchanted, many came to believe that nothing but the abandonment of ‘lethargic’ Chinese tradition (an elliptical attack on the party) and blanket emulation of ‘advanced’ Western societies could bridge the gap between China and the outside world.272 In a sense, some-thing along such lines was under way with economic restructuring running at full steam. Yet the CCP obstinately kept afloat the decaying institution of communism, silencing those who dared call for similar restructuring in the political sphere. That the reformist leadership in principle proclaimed a clean break from the past, yet in practice shared its forerunners’ penchant for authoritarian means, only drove the wedge between the party-state and the people even deeper.273
	In short, due to the adverse socioeconomic side-effects of reform, and the CCP’s ideo-logical miscalculations—and a whole cluster of other issues which we cannot possibly sort out here—domestic pressures steadily built up throughout the 1980s, pushing the nation further away from the state and closer to an idealized ‘West.’ The long-simmering public discontent finally boiled over in 1989, when hundreds of thousands of young Chinese poured to the capital and filled Tiananmen Square, demanding in no uncertain terms the dethronement of the incumbent regime. And we know how that turned out.
4.1.2   Reorientation
It may be questioned whether there really are ‘watershed’ moments in history. How possibly could we pinpoint a major shift in the human condition to any specific point in time? What is certain, however, is that some events retrospectively come to occupy a ‘watershed’ position in the historical consciousness. This is very true of the murderous conclusion to the Tiananmen protests. Consider, for instance, just how common the temporal marker ‘post-1989’ is in Western analyses on contemporary China. Did, on the night of June Fourth, one China cease to be, and another China spring into existence? In reality, of course not; but in the hearts and minds of countless people, Chinese and Western alike, very much so.
	The tempest of 1989 surely was a ‘watershed’ to the Communist leaders as much as to anyone else. There is little doubt that this episode set in motion a process of profound re-alignment within the CCP. If anything, it brought the party hard up against the fact that a thorough overhaul of its ideological foundations was perilously overdue. Put crudely, un-less the Communists buried communism, they had no future at the helm of the country.274 Nor could they count on economic performance alone to secure allegiances: clearly, cater-ing to the people’s material needs and goading them to get rich quick, in the absence of a coalescing ideology, had done little to encourage popular identification with the the party-state. A new set of ‘spiritual pillars’ was direly needed to solidify the regime’s hold on power.
	It was at this low point that the CCP reinvented itself under the banner of nationalism, as a last-ditch effort to draw the wayward nation back into the fold.275 Communism was discarded in all but name.276 The party scrapped the hoary ideal of socialist revolution, an-choring its legitimacy instead on its historical contributions to the nation and, in particular, on the contributions it was yet to make. Likewise, the party shed its outdated role as the ‘vanguard of the Chinese proletariat,’ and repositioned itself as the ‘most thoroughgoing patriot,’ so as to accommodate a much broader definition of the nation.277 By opting for a more inclusive approach to nationhood, the CCP could claim to represent all of the Chi-nese people irrespective of class or creed—indeed, even of citizenship—thereby resolving the awkward conundrum of a ‘two-tiered nation’ within China, while also allowing mem-bership for ‘diasporic’ Chinese outside the People’s Republic.278 In sum, by converting from a communist party into a nationalist one, the CCP sought to enlist the support of the widest possible spectrum of people who, rather than share any particular ideological pre-tensions, in one way or another identify themselves as distinctly ‘Chinese,’ whether on or off the mainland.
	It is easy for us, with the advantage of hindsight, to say that this was a smart move. The turn to nationalism is a crucial factor in explaining how the Communist leadership managed to ride out the storm of 1989—no mean achievement by any standards. As Thomas Christensen notes in an oft-cited 1996 article, nationalism quickly became “the sole ideological glue that holds the People’s Republic together and keeps the CCP govern-ment in power. Since the Chinese Communist Party is no longer communist,” he pithily adds, “it must be even more Chinese.”279 The hairsplitting over ‘watersheds’ aside, it makes analytical sense to think of June Fourth as a decisive turning point in contemporary Chinese history, whereupon one CCP ends, and another begins. Now, we may ask, what does any of this have to do with the ‘Century’?
4.1.3   Digging up the past
A key feature of Chinese political discourse is the top-down imposition of a singular ‘true story’ about the nation’s past, present, and future, that ideally should crowd out all the dis-cordant stories spawning bottom-up or middle-out.280 As discussed above, the exact oppo-site occurred in the 1980s, when the official story of socialist revolution was outflanked by a chorus of alternative voices, many of which envisioned a future without the CCP. The party’s conversion to nationalism, obviously, required that a new story be compiled. As the regime, at this critical juncture, was under more public pressure than ever, it was of signal importance whether part of that pressure could be redirected elsewhere. And where better than the West? To this end, rekindling the bitter memory of imperialist aggression seemed a logical choice. (Perhaps the octogenarian leaders recalled the exhilaration of the anti-im-perialist rallies in their youth, like Yang Gongsu, cited at the outset of this chapter.) Thus, party ideologues—and this is the part that concerns us—disinterred the ‘Century,’ placing it at the discursive epicenter of their new official story.281
	So what exactly does this story tell us? Though this will be examined in some detail in the next section, it is pertinent to outline the main points here. First, as just stated, there is a near exclusive focus on the ‘Century’: the invasions, massacres, plunderings, ‘unequal treaties,’ lost territories, and other humiliations that China suffered at the hands of foreign imperialists and corrupt rulers. The aim is to highlight, often quite explicitly, the peace and prosperity of life under Communist rule since 1949 (needless to say, the scourges of the Mao period, that would make the ‘Century’ pale in comparison,282 are not so much as al-luded to). National time is thus artificially divided into an undesirable past and a desirable present, showcasing what the West and the CCP, respectively, have offered the nation. Sec-ond, the story pushes the idea that China, due to its unique historical and cultural physiog-nomy, possesses a one-of-a-kind ‘national condition,’ with which everything but socialism, as prescribed by the CCP, is fundamentally incompatible. The purpose here, of course, is to defuse the challenge of Western alternatives, liberal democracy foremost, thereby letting the CCP alone stake a claim to China’s future.283 Finally, there is the conviction that the ‘Century’ exposes foreigners for what they really are: barbarian bullies who never ceased to have designs on China. A true patriot, then, must always remain vigilant against foreign threats, and place their full confidence in the party—for no other loves China as the party does, and no other can keep the nation from being hauled back into the nightmare of the ‘Century.’ In brief, the official story uses a highly sanitized history as an argument to legit-imize the CCP, and delegitimize everything else, both in the past and the future—all coat-ed in an elusive language of patriotism and Chinese exceptionalism.284
	Though this story presumably was not spun overnight, first signs could be seen as ear-ly as 1989. In the immediate wake of the crackdown, the CCP, in its usual manner, heaped all blame on the West by insisting that the protests were a direct outcome of Western cul-tural sabotage.285 Scapegoating foreigners, in and of itself, was nothing out of the ordinary; what was ‘new,’ however, was that the familiar conspiracy allegations, loudly trumpeted in official pronouncements and state-controlled media, were now interspersed with allusions to the ‘Century.’ Besides evoking the past as ‘proof’ of hidden Western agendas, the CCP also voiced concern over a perceived absence of patriotism: only love for the motherland could guard against foreign intrigues, went the message, and it was precisely due to the youth’s lack thereof that the imperialists’ ‘spiritual opium’ had poisoned their minds.286 Past humiliation, Western conspiracy, calls for patriotism: this heralded a pattern that, in keeping with the new official story, would come to dominate much of the post-1989 offi-cial discourse—that is, the persistent portrayal of China as a victim, and of the West as a villain, by superimposing the trauma of the ‘Century’ on current events.287 Deng Xiaoping himself, commenting in 1990 on the UN sanctions levied against China, gave an early demonstration by bringing up the occupation of Beijing ninety years prior. What he meant to imply, of course, is that Western powers today still are the same thugs as before, and China still is the victim of their predatory instincts:
“As a Chinese person, I know well of the history of foreign aggression against China. When it came to my attention that the seven Western countries, at their summit meeting, had decided to impose sanctions on China, I instantly thought of 1900, the year that the Eight-Nation Alliance invaded China. Excluding Canada, six out of these seven countries, together with Czarist Russia and Austria, are the same eight powers that formed the Alli-ance that year.”288
4.1.4   Patriotic education
Publicly, Deng diverted attention with far-fetched historical allegory; behind the scenes, he was more honest about the situation. When addressing cadres, he quite rightly pointed at the dysfunction of political education. The people had turned their backs on the party, he diagnosed, not so much because foreigners had put them under a spell, but because the party had failed to preach a meaningful alternative to the West.289 As we have repeated throughout this section, the CCP then threw Marx out of the window, and turned instead to a history-oriented nationalism for a new source of legitimacy. But what did this mean in practice? Quite simply, it meant that young Chinese had to be reminded of the ‘Century’: to relive the horrors that their elders suffered at the hands of foreigners; to internalize the spirit of patriotism that grew out of that galling ordeal; and, most importantly, to appreciate the CCP for making things right again.290 (It is not hard to see how this is reflected in the new official story.) The following remark from Zhang Zhuhong, a history professor with a strong party affiliation, is representative:
“The youth have neither experienced semi-colonial life first-hand, nor do they have a cor-rect understanding of modern history. They are born and raised under the Red Flag, lead happy and fulfilling lives, yet know nothing of what it is like for a nation to be oppressed and bullied. They are oblivious to national humiliation. This is where education is needed most urgently.”291
Another author echoes a similar sentiment:
“We must educate young people in national humiliation, to acquaint them with the days when the land was strewn with corpses and awash in blood, and the sound of wailing shook the earth. They must forever remember these grievous wounds that still fester to-day.”292
	But it would take much more than clever quips from comrade Xiaoping and a volley of editorials in the state-run press to get the message across. The situation called for a sys-tematic and extensive program of (re)education, that would make full use of the Commu-nists’ propaganda expertise. Thus, party ideologues and pedagogues set to work. Not long after, as we have mentioned, a burgeoning literature on the ‘Century,’ mostly tailored for young non-academic audiences, began to be churned out. The proper launch of a nation-wide ‘patriotic education’ campaign had to wait until after Deng’s 1992 southern tour (whereby he effectively put an end to the factional infighting that was bogging the CCP down).293 Once under way, it became clear that this campaign was no half-measure. The party-state deployed the entire arsenal of indoctrination at its disposal to ensure a sustained propaganda barrage, directed in particular at the youth, from kindergartens all the way through to universities and the army. By 1993–94 the endeavor was running at full throttle, with children, students, and servicemen all over the country learning modern Chinese his-tory (instead of Marxist doctrine), watching patriotic films, penning patriotic essays, visit-ing museums and historical sites designated as ‘patriotic education bases,’ participating in patriotic sing-alongs and flag-raising ceremonies, and so on.294 As it gained momentum, the campaign extended beyond classrooms and drill grounds into the public space (com-memorative events, monuments, roadside banners and billboards), and further still into the realm of entertainment (mass media, popular culture, feature films). As a result, the image-ry and vocabulary of state-sanctioned patriotism have come to—and still do—penetrate all aspects of daily life in the People’s Republic.295 It is almost impossible not to be exposed to the official story in one form or another.
	But does patriotic education work? Though there is little empirical support, it has become commonsensical to say that it does—like a charm, some would add. After all, the Communist regime is still in power, and the Chinese people would appear to be highly nationalistic in a way that serves the state’s interests. “The campaign,” Wang Zheng observes, “has proven to be one of the most important maneuvers the party has conducted for its survival in the post-Tiananmen and post–Cold War eras.”296 Zhao Suisheng, whose 1998 article on the campaign is a staple reference, goes so far as to assert that it was “directly responsible for the nationalistic sentiment of the Chinese people in the mid-1990s.”297 This is evident, it is typically argued, in how readily the masses rally around the flag whenever the party decides that foreigners have hurt the nation’s collective feelings; or how they, if the perceived affront is severe enough, take to the streets in a fit of indigna-tion, shouting the received wisdoms about anti-China conspiracies and national humilia-tion force-fed to them by the government. If nothing else, a moderate observer may con-cur, patriotic education has been remarkably effective and long-lasting compared to the CCP’s earlier campaigns: whereas the latter, relying on little more than hollow slogan-re-citing, quickly ran out of steam, the former, owing to its practical pedagogy and clever use of new media technologies, shows no signs of deceleration even after running for over two decades. As Callahan notes, the fact that patriotic education is engaging and entertaining—that nationalism is ‘performed’ and ‘consumed’ rather than ‘thought’—goes a long way in explaining its appeal and vitality.298
	Indeed, there is no denying that patriotic education has been successful to some extent. But still, it would be rash to conclude that the 1990s nationalist upsurge was caused by a propaganda campaign. Though the party-state does play a decisive role here, the ‘new nationalism,’ as was briefly noted earlier, cannot be explained away simply as government puppeteering. So, lest we give undue credit to the CCP’s ingenuity, we must consider the nonstate factors that played a role of equal, if not greater importance. First of all, the Communists did not so much ‘invent,’ as ‘cash in on’ nationalism. As we have seen, this is a sentiment that took shape spontaneously in the 1910s–20s and, though repressed for decades by Maoist orthodoxy, has likely always remained at the heart of modern Chinese identity. Whatever success the CCP’s nationalist project has had, to again quote Callahan, is largely because it “draw[s] on ideas that preceded the state—civilization and barbarism, national pride and national humiliation—that resonate with popular feelings.”299
	Furthermore, Western powers by their actions, perhaps inadvertently, contributed much to the radicalization of Chinese public opinion. Patriotic education would have been of little consequence if not for ‘favorable’ external stimuli that lent credence to what the party was saying. In particular, the collapse of the Cold War order, and the harsh China policy pursued by many Western countries after 1989 seemed to validate the CCP’s warn-ings about another ‘Century.’ First, the disintegration of the USSR, followed by America’s perceived cold-shouldering of post-communist Russia, sent a chill down the spine of many Chinese observers: had the events of 1989 taken a different turn, they mused, China might have shared the same fate. Then, as the US continued to press for sanctions against China, a geopolitical fear began to take hold among Chinese analysts: soon they were convinced that the West had found in the People’s Republic a new nemesis to replace the defunct So-viet Union.300 Incidentally, as if to prove these suspicions correct, American pundits began speculating about a ‘China threat’—which, of course, did not go overlooked by the Chi-nese. This set in motion a vicious circle of mutual fear-mongering, fueled by mispercep-tion and paranoia on both sides of the Pacific.301 Neo-authoritarian and neo-Confucian voices, animated by a pathological need to denounce and reject everything ‘Western,’ gained enough leverage to enter the intellectual mainstream, where they remain to this day.302 It certainly did not ease the situation that Sino–US relations were punctuated by minor conflicts throughout the 1990s, from the Taiwan Strait crisis to the Belgrade embas-sy bombing. In Chinese eyes, it was as though the West revealed its true colors over and again. Finally, on a very down-to-earth level, first-hand contact with and personal experi-ences in Western societies—perhaps more so than anything else—effectively discounted the utopian image of the ‘West’ that many had built in their minds in the 1980s. National-ism, then, offered an easy refuge from cultural shock, disillusionment, and discrimination (whether real or imaginary).303
	It would be well to point out that not everyone is convinced of the campaign’s effica-cy. The angry crowds that occasionally spill out onto the streets to besiege embassies, boy-cott Carrefours, and smash Toyotas, goes the counter-argument, are only a visible and vo-cal minority—which is probably true. Julia Lovell, for one, is not impressed: “For all the success of young Chinese nationalists in periodically grandstanding Western media cover-age,” she writes, “almost every Chinese urbanite I have spoken to is embarrassed by them, refusing to admit they represent the mainstream.”304 Curiously, Chinese teachers—the ‘operatives’ of patriotic education who deal with it on a daily basis—are not impressed either. A routine complaint to appear in Chinese education journals is that patriotic educa-tion is either inefficient or insufficient. Kids and teens these days, the teachers lament, are too self-involved to care about the burning of Yuanmingyuan.305
*   *   *
In this section, we have reviewed one of the more common arguments in anglophone scholarship on contemporary China: that the ideologically bankrupt CCP, in the aftermath of 1989, used nationalism to fill the vacuum left by the implosion of communism, so as to woo back a population that had drifted further away from its grasp than ever before. This is of interest to us only insofar as it explains the 1990s resurgence of national humiliation: as we have seen, the Communists did not pull a ‘new’ nationalism out of thin air, but rath-er recycled the ‘old,’ or ‘original’ nationalism that, in the early twentieth century, so pow-erfully appealed to Chinese across all walks of life (old wine in a new bottle, if you will). This enterprise, if we may simplify a bit, was all about introducing the nation’s misguided youth to the trauma of the ‘Century,’ and thereby have them understand that foreigners still want to “carve China up like a melon,” and that only the CCP can secure the nation from this perpetual threat. To make sure the message hit home, the party-state launched a multi-media patriotic education campaign that would come to pervade all of public life. Though it is unknown to what extent this campaign has influenced popular perception, it at the very least has, for its sheer scope and duration, seared the ‘Century’ anew onto public con-sciousness. For whatever reason, many young Chinese, or at least a particularly vocal seg-ment thereof, are now acutely aware of China’s past humiliations, and seem very assured that the West and Japan will do everything in their power to undermine China’s rise to its rightful place as a major power—which conveniently steers their ire away from the do-mestic sphere.
	Provided that the ‘Century’ now underpins the CCP’s political legitimacy, then this should somehow be reflected in the ‘Century’ literature. And indeed it is. In the next section, we will take one last look at the Chinese-language writings to see how exactly China’s post-communist Communists ‘use the past to serve the present.’
4.2   Lessons of history
The ‘Century’ authors, as wardens of public memory, have two things to worry about. First, there is always the chance that people remember what they should forget. Though this concern remains unstated in the ‘Century’ writings, it is at times articulated elsewhere. For instance, whenever an unorthodox reappraisal of history slips into public awareness, a volley of venomous rebuttals is bound to follow.306 Second, conversely, there is also the chance that people forget what they should remember—and this concern, unlike the other, is voiced very explicitly in the writings. A typical account either begins or ends with lam-entation over the erosion of memory, whether due to generational change, popular indiffer-ence, or just the passage of time:
“More than one hundred and fifty years have passed since the imperialists first fired their cannon on the South China Sea. And it is already half a century since the last Jap devil was chased out of China . . . The Chinese race’s history of humiliation will be forever en-graved on the hearts of the older generation. But for younger people it is, after all, a thing of the remote past.”307
“The elderly pass away, ruins crumble to dust, memories wither and fade. New tempta-tions, desires, ideas, and dreams come thick and fast . . . The folds and creases of time, just like that—inexorably and silently—conceal the wounds and scars of the past.”308
	What the authors mean to say, of course, is that the ‘Century’ must not be forgotten—not just for the sake of remembering, though, but because “history is a mirror.”309 It is not a thing of the past, they insist, but a warning for the future—one that China simply cannot afford to forget, “lest history repeat itself.”310 Put another way, if the Chinese let the ‘Cen-tury’ slip from memory, they will bring another ‘Century’ on themselves. This is to say, in effect, that disregard for the past is complicity in the nation’s demise: as the authors repeat-edly remind us, “to forget the past is treachery.”311
	So, the main purpose of remembering the ‘Century,’ simply enough, is to keep it from happening again. But apart from this, there are also beneficial side-effects: this particular memory can serve as a goad to action, help reverse trends of moral decline, even elevate the individual into proper personhood. “Now that most people are so caught up in eco-nomic development and material pleasures that they have forgotten all about national hu-miliation,” one author explains, it is more vital than ever to remind them of the “painful lessons” of the past, in order to “make them understand that the nation’s glory is their glo-ry, its shame their shame.” Only thus can the “rampant egoism and debauchery” be kept in check.312 By knowing the shame and bitterness of the ‘Century,’ people will “appreciate the happiness of today, love the motherland even more ardently, and aspire to wash away national humiliation.”313 One author plays the tradition card by noting that “ancient Chi-nese thinkers associated shame with virtue.” In the eyes of Confucius, Mencius, and many others, he adds, “a sense of shame is what sets humans apart from animals.”314 Indeed, whereas forgetting spells doom, nothing bad comes from remembering. Thus, article after article, we are entreated “never to forget.”
	But it is no mean task to memorize the ‘Century’ (reductive and simplified though it is). For all the scaremongering about “treachery” and “history repeating itself,” the aver-age reader can hardly be expected to go through the trouble. Therefore, to make things considerably easier, the authors kindly compress the whole experience into a few, concise “lessons of history”—a fixed set reproduced in more or less every account, in the exact same words, presented as the only correct conclusion to be drawn from modern Chinese history. ‘Never forgetting,’ then, is no longer a question of actually remembering the ‘Century,’ but of understanding the lessons that should be learned therefrom. This, not unexpectedly, is where politics creep in. In this section, we will examine the lessons that the Chinese people must take to heart, if they are to keep the ‘Century’ where it belongs—on the pages of history. As we will see, each one of these lessons plays directly into the hands of the CCP.
4.2.1   The perils of being backward
If there is one thing that the ‘Century’ taught China, it is that “the backward are beaten”—that the world is governed by might rather than right, and that in such a world, falling on the wayside inevitably leads to enslavement or, worse still, to extermination. “The back-ward are beaten, the destitute are beaten, the ignorant are beaten.”315 And what could better attest to this social Darwinist maxim, the authors ask, than feudal China’s humiliating en-counter with the industrialized, capitalist West? Remember how the Qing dynasty’s failure to keep up with Europe opened the floodgates for foreign invasion? Or how the Great Qing’s successors just repeated the same mistakes, putting the nation further in harm’s way? Indeed, China was beaten and bullied for a hundred years on end, so the lesson goes, because she was ‘backward.’ This, to the authors, is the ultimate wisdom distilled from the vicissitudes of China’s modern past: an article of faith that is devoutly chanted over and over again, so that the message gets across even to the most casual of readers. “That the backward are beaten,” as one author announces, “is an ironclad law that, at any time, in any corner of the world, brooks no exception whatsoever.”316
	If history truly is a mirror, and if the ‘backward’ are bound for a beating as if by some universal law, then what does this tell about the world today? This, of course, raises the frightful prospect that what happened during the ‘Century’ could happen again any time—after all, China is still relatively ‘backward’ and, like it or not, caught in the middle of an altogether malign world.317 The authors belabor the point that foreign powers today, even if their outward appearance might suggest otherwise, are in no significant way different from those in the past.318 Recalling the ‘Century’ makes it immediately clear how Westerners, with their sanctions, embargos, ‘China threat’ polemic, and what not, still “boss others around with the same arrogance as they used to treat their colonial subjects.”319 Like their imperialist forebears, they prey on China day and night, raring to exploit any vulnerability or opening to “rend her asunder.”320 “For a long time now,” one author knowingly explains, “they have been stretching their collective ingenuity to come up with ways to contain socialist New China. Not a moment goes by that they are not fantasizing about a comeback.”321 “We must be perfectly aware,” echoes another, “that imperialists have never given up their ambition to annihilate us.”322 What is different, though, is that where the foreigners in the past used cannon and opium, they now utilize more subtle tactics:
“Today, the naked plunder and brazen aggression of imperialism would run counter to the tide of the times. It is as if the world has become civilized, and the relations between nations equal. However, the principle that ‘the backward are beaten and the corrupt suffer defeat’ remains as valid as ever. Developed Western countries, through unequal trade rela-tions, still exploit and expropriate their impoverished and backward counterparts. They are merely using economic means to complete the unjust transaction that their predeces-sors commenced.”323
	The quote above speaks of “unequal trade relations.” Such neo-imperialist shenani-gans, however, are by no means limited only to trade and commerce. In fact, the “suave, poker-faced” Westerners, as one author contends, have insidiously dragged China into a nontraditional, multi-front “war over economics, science, technology, politics, diplomacy, culture, talent, hearts and minds, information, the internet,” and so on.324 Such a wide range of areas and activities are regarded as a foreign conspiracy, that one wonders what is not so regarded. By superimposing the ‘Century’ directly onto the present, the authors thus arrive at the unnerving conclusion that everything—truly, everything—coming from for-eign nations is somehow aimed at undermining China.325
	The past, then, is summoned as ‘proof’ of evil foreign intentions, wherever a historical parallel may be drawn. One author, for instance, questions the motives of “Westerners who go on preaching about ‘humanity’ and ‘human rights,’ coming up with whatever sorry excuse to attack socialist China,” in light of how “their ancestors” in 1900 sacked Beijing and butchered Boxers.326 Another expresses particular concern for how Japanese “right-wingers,” with their persistent whitewashing of history and frequent visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, try to “steer the younger generation toward militarism,” thereby “implanting into them a hatred for other nations.”327 Admittedly, the exhortations to “be on guard against the revival of Japanese militarism” are quite understandable, seeing that it once was a very real and imminent threat to China. The irritation at “human rights evangelism” is not that hard to appreciate, either, in view of China’s experience with imperialism (though it is a severe case of presentism to claim that Western nations in 1900 operated on the same moral principles as they do today). But what should raise an eyebrow is how the ‘Century’ is called on to identify new threats and enemies: “Looking at the ‘Diaoyu Islands incident’ through the lens of modern history,” one author counsels, we should readily discern “an American conspiracy to thwart China’s development, contain China’s rise, and thus prevent China from challenging America’s position in the Asia-Pacific, if not globally.”328 Somehow the ‘Century’ also validates the allegations that foreigners are covertly sowing seeds of dissent among China’s minorities, in hope of “turning the Chinese people against each other, and tearing the country apart at the seams.”329 Besides new threats, the endless evocations of the ‘Century’ also create new humiliations, as isolated incidents in the pres-ent are understood as a recurring past. “We must not forget,” one author urges, “the new national wounds inflicted on us in recent years by such episodes as the embassy bombing, the spy plane collision, and the Yinhe incident.”330
	So where does all this leave us? The bottom line is that, in such a dog-eat-dog world, the Chinese cannot afford weakness or disunity—to be ‘backward’—lest they risk falling victim to yet another round of mortifying humiliations. “If we do not do something about our backward condition soon, and let the imperialists’ schemes come to fruition,” as one author cautions, “then the humiliating history of the Chinese people’s oppression and ex-ploitation will be replayed all over again.”331 “Why is it,” asks another,
“that Lee Teng-hui and his ilk—let alone that rebel-on-the-run, Dalai Lama—are wel-comed as distinguished guests in so many countries, despite the fact that Taiwan and Tibet are part of China’s sacred territory? Why is it that some countries come parading their air-craft carriers, when China conducts military exercises within its maritime territory? Why is it that the container ship Yinhe, while going about its routine business in international waters, was arbitrarily harassed and inspected? Why is it that our embassy in Belgrade was savagely bombed by NATO? One might expect a complex answer, but at bottom it’s just three words: comprehensive national power!”332
	A negative and discouraging outlook thus encourages positive action: the Chinese must remedy their country’s ‘backward condition’ by increasing ‘comprehensive national power’—or, plainly put, by making China strong. But this is not as simple as it sounds. It turns out that there is only one road to national strength, and only one leader to take China down that road (the ‘Century’ proves this as well).
4.2.2   Liberation
In the previous chapter, the notion of a domestic crisis of leadership surfaced on two sepa-rate occasions, but was not pursued further therein. Now that we are considering the politi-cal coloring of the ‘Century,’ the context is right for that. Earlier we touched only on the basics: that foreign infiltration into the country was greatly facilitated by the Qing govern-ment’s ‘backwardness,’ that the people’s efforts to drive out the enemies were bound to fail due to misdirection, and that the ‘Century’ drew to a close only when these problems were properly remedied. The question, then, is how was the crisis overcome, and by whose agency?
	This takes us back to the story of resistance. Besides the “revolutionary martyrs” who were out on the field, fighting the foreigners tooth and nail, there were also “men of high ideals” whose struggles were of a more intellectual kind. These forward-looking individu-als were well aware of their rulers’ shortcomings, and were intent on finding a solution thereto. From late Qing through to the Republic, statesmen and literati across all persua-sions scoured the world of learning for clues to reversing China’s shameful nosedive. A wide variety of formulae for “national salvation” were propounded and put to practice—however, due to the “limitations of history,” goes the routine explanation, all these endeav-ors went up in smoke.333 Reformists, revolutionaries, and radicals, despite their passion for novel ideas, were so entangled in old patterns of thought that they always ended up back at square one: they “reduced the feudal order of old to ruins,” as one author puts it, “only to build from the rubble another kind of Celestial Empire.”334 “Faced with the wretched straits of the Chinese race,” another sums up, “many patriots set out to search for a path to national salvation—but they all failed.” There were “reformists of the landlord class,” such as Lin Zexu and Wei Yuan, whose dictum “to master the foreigners, first master the secrets of their technology” proved insufficient; there were “bourgeois reformists,” such as Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao, whose advocacy of constitutional monarchy ended in a bloody coup d’état; there was Sun Yat-sen and his “bourgeois revolutionaries,” who toppled the feudal monarchy, but had little with which to replace it. In spite of all these efforts, goes the conclusion, “the Chinese people still had not been delivered from the heavy yoke of imperialism.” Then, of course, follows the question (as if the answer was not glaringly obvious): “Who could save China? Who could emancipate the nation?”335
	It was not until the last years of the ‘Century’ that a truly progressive force, with the proper cure for China’s disease, entered the stage of history. “The CCP, Mao Zedong at the helm,” political wisdom tells us, “successfully integrated the basic tenets of Marxism–Leninism with the concrete realities of China, thereby blazing the way to victory.”336 At the darkest hour of the ‘War of Resistance,’ the disparate and exhausted nation rallied under the colors of the CCP and stood up to oppression in a united front.337 Then, in rapid succes-sion, the foreign invaders were expelled, the ‘unequal treaties’ abrogated, and the Nation-alist traitors thrown out of the mainland.338 With the 1949 founding of the PRC, the Chi-nese people, “under the correct leadership of the CCP,” finally “brought China’s tortured and blood-soaked modern history to a close.”339
	It is true that Chinese intellectuals of the time were mostly preoccupied with trying to think of a way out of China’s predicament, proposing a great many solutions to reclaiming the country.340 But what the authors do is interpret this intellectual pursuit as a sequence of trial and error, that in the end boils down to only one viable choice. From this perspective, it is as if a large pool of candidates auditioned for the role of China’s savior, yet all but one were disqualified by the transcendent force of ‘History.’ This teleological line of thinking is spelled out explicitly in the writings—notice how history is repeatedly summoned as a judge to pass its impersonal verdict:
“The course of history is inexorable. It can only unfold by its own inherent laws . . . As the progress of history proves, only the CCP can shoulder the historical responsibility of leading China’s invigoration . . . This is the summary of our modern revolution and strug-gle; it is the historical decision made by the Chinese people on the basis of over a hundred years’ worth of trial and error.”341
	By this logic, it was no stroke of luck nor a whim of fate that it was the CCP, and no other, that in 1949 ‘liberated’ China. Rather, this was the inevitable outcome dictated by history itself. It is “an indisputable truth, scientifically validated by the hundred years of modern Chinese history,” that “without the CCP, there would be no New China.”342 In other words, if not for the CCP’s great contributions, Chinese today would still find them-selves mired in poverty and pogrom, instead of looking back on it as a bygone chapter. And so, we have another ‘lesson of history’:
“Without the CCP, there would be no New China. Without the CCP, New China would not be so strong and prosperous. If not for the CCP, national humiliation would not have been wiped away, nor would have Hong Kong returned to the motherland. The patriotism of the CCP sets the highest example for the Chinese race and the Chinese nation.”343
4.2.3   Rejuvenation
All well in the past—but what of the future? Touting the CCP’s messianic credentials may well retroactively sanctify its rise to power, but does little to keep its mandate from expir-ing thereafter. Besides providing a rationale for Communist rule in the past, even more importantly, the authors must extend that rationale to the future as well. To this end, they posit that history entrusted the CCP not only with the task of ‘liberation,’ but also with the even greater task of ‘rejuvenation.’ While the former was achieved in 1949, the latter is “yet far from completion.”344 And just as only the CCP could ‘liberate’ the nation from the yoke of imperialism, so too it alone can ‘rejuvenate’ China’s rightful place at the first rung of the pecking order, no matter how long it takes.345 The country’s recent hyperdevelop-ment is frequently adduced to corroborate these claims. The authors try to persuade us that it is all thanks to the party that China has worked its way up from the bottom of the heap to being a global pacesetter. “This radical historical change is the direct result of the CCP’s leadership,” one author explains, “it is the result of the Chinese people’s taking the social-ist road, and of implementing the policy of reform and opening up” (the third part is ad-mittedly quite true).346 Yet at the same time, we are told that China’s present prosperity is not the end of the line—and, besides, there is the eternal trouble with the hungry foreign wolves, itching to tear the backward to bits and pieces. The road ahead is long and narrow, such that one misstep would, with abiding certainty, send China plummeting back to the nadir of the food chain. “That the Chinese race is no longer being carved and gobbled up, and now has a civilized and powerful homeland striding toward prosperity,” one author counsels, “is inseparable from the fact that the people took the socialist road under the leadership of the CCP.” If China were to stray from that road, he then warns, it would “at once lose independence and sovereignty, and be reduced to a mere vassal of Western capitalist powers.”347 So there you have it: without the CCP, it is just the ‘Century’ all over again.
	The Communist regime is well aware that sustained modernization (which ultimately keeps it in power) depends entirely on active engagement with the world. So, we may ask, why should it secure its footing by wrapping the nation in a false sense of besiegement? The imperative of ‘never forgetting’ ancient grudges, readily feeding into an us-against-them mentality, sits awkwardly with the much greater imperative of economic moderniza-tion. The two, however, are not at odds. The pragmatic leaders’ strategic thinking is encod-ed directly into the writings, so as to address the moral quandary of having to consort with “imperialist gangsters.”348 Even as the ‘Century’ appears to caution otherwise, China must nonetheless keep its door open—did not the Qing dynasty’s self-imposed isolation precipi-tate its demise? Sustained reform powered by foreign input, we are told, is the absolute precondition for maintaining a strong state, holding the enemy at bay and, in the long run, fulfilling the core task of China’s ‘rejuvenation.’349 Then, we are once more assured that only the CCP, as the architect and instigator of reform, is qualified to see this process through to its conclusion.350 Finally, it is stressed that the CCP’s performance in this re-spect depends on domestic stability which, in turn, depends on the day-to-day ventures of the people.351 Thus, all Chinese who would rather witness a strong and affluent China are entreated to, if not contribute to the party-state’s undertaking, at least refrain from derailing its advances.
	Reading through any ‘Century’ account, as we have seen, there is ceaseless chatter about past humiliation, benumbing reminders of China’s victimization, fulmination against imperialist atrocities, warnings about every imaginable conspiracy. Then, there are calls to ‘wipe away’ these humiliations, if not to ‘avenge blood debts.’ Yet, in the end, it all comes down to maintaining domestic stability and keeping the door open for foreign investment. “The point is by no means to have the people take up arms and invade other countries,” as one author clarifies, “but to inscribe national humiliation in their hearts, such that they will work hard to make the homeland strong and prosperous, and thereby prevent the tragedy of history from repeating itself.”352 “To never forget national humiliation,” echoes another, “is to throw oneself into socialist modernization, and make contributions to the rise of the Chinese nation.”353 Still, someone always gets the wrong idea: “We do not need people out on the streets demonstrating and boycotting Japanese products,” admonishes one author (commenting on the nationwide wave of anti-Japanese protests in 2005), “what we need is that the whole nation, with one heart and one mind, commit themselves to strengthening the country. Development is the overriding priority.”354 Humiliation is best ‘cleansed,’ it would seem, by shutting one’s mouth and making money.
*   *   *
In this section, we have taken stock of the lessons taught China by the ‘Century.’ They are simple and few—and unequivocally political. First, there is the insistence that, though decades have since passed, fundamentally nothing has changed. Beneath the sugar-coating of peace and cooperation, the world is still a dreadful place where the strong eat the weak, and where the ‘backward’ are mercilessly beaten. Though it may not look like it, China is still assailed on all sides by hostile external forces, who desire nothing so much as to bring China down to her knees—and they’re all in it together, too. The reader should now be scratching their head as to why China is not down on her knees, but standing upright, chin up and chest out. The answer, of course, is none other than the CCP, introduced into the story as a messianic agency entrusted by history with the twin tasks of ‘liberation’ and ‘rejuvenation.’ The fulfillment of the former in 1949 confirms the CCP’s inevitability in the past, and the promise of the latter projects its indispensability far into the future. Just as only the party could close the door on the ‘Century,’ goes the lesson, so too it alone can keep the nation on its current trajectory toward ‘rejuvenation.’ Choose any other path, the reader is cautioned, and China is no more. This is not open for argument: it is “an indisput-able fact of history.” In brief, the ‘Century’ is invoked as a warning of the fate in store for the Chinese, if they dare interfere with the party’s grand plan, which only the party knows and understands. Thus, at the end of the day, to ‘never forget national humiliation’ is noth-ing so complicated as to ‘do exactly as the party-state says.’
	Few would quarrel with the idea that history is a mirror, and that there are lessons to be drawn from past experience. Indeed, the past is never past, in the sense that it has much to say to the present, and can provide insight into the future. But like mirrors, histories too can be bent into various shapes, and made to reflect whatever it is that we want to see. So, does China’s modern past “undeniably” and “inexorably” prove, as the authors claim, that the backward are beaten, and that only the CCP could, and can, save China from such a wretched fate? Here, let us use the following observation by Paul Cohen as an answer:
“History may, indeed, be the best proof. But only in certain circumstances, and only when it is appealed to for answers to questions that are genuinely open-ended. When the ques-tions are closed and the appeal to history is not for answers but for confirmation of posi-tions that have already been arrived at, history may offer comfort but it ‘proves’ noth-ing.”355
	There is no question about it: these lessons are not read from the past, but written back into it. The CCP draws on a highly selective and reductive history to ‘prove’ a preordained point, that has everything to do with politics, and nothing to do with reality. This device is familiar to us from the previous chapter—namely, we are again dealing with myth. We demonstrated earlier that the ‘Century’ renders a rich and complex past into a black-and-white morality tale that serves nationalist ends. Now we have seen how that reading is further reduced to a teleological mandate that serves political ends. All things considered, it should be safe to conclude that the ‘Century’ is a myth to the power of two: it elevates nationalists and ennobles the regime, all at the expense of historical accuracy. Ironically, the further it is detached from the facts, the louder it claims to represent those facts.
4.3   Conclusion
In the late 1970s, after the overthrow of the ‘Gang of Four,’ there was renewed interest in Empress Dowager Cixi—mostly because of her apparent similarity to Jiang Qing, Mao’s last wife and head of the ‘Gang,’ who at the time were publicly blamed for the ravages of the Cultural Revolution. Hong Kong director Li Han-hsiang, who then had the opportunity to shoot on location at historical sites in Beijing, also jumped on the bandwagon and de-cided to make a film about Cixi. But what began with Cixi would develop into something else: released in 1983, Burning of the imperial palace, as the title suggests, was all about the 1860 Anglo–French occupation of the capital, and the consequent destruction of Yuan-mingyuan.356 Li explained the change of emphasis in an interview:
“Cixi’s history is the same as China’s modern history of invasion and enslavement by Western powers. With this film, we can let young people know that the weak and back-ward are beaten. Which, I think, is very meaningful.”357
	Much of the ninety-minute dramatization focuses on the events that led up to the titu-lar burning. There is court intrigue and romance (this is the Cixi part of the story); battles in which Manchu troops are mown down to the last man by British cannon fire; rude and foulmouthed Europeans with their unreasonable demands and ginger neckbeards; and stunning reconstructions of the imperial gardens at the height of their splendor. There is also a little comic relief: in one scene, prince Senggelinqin, having had his fill of British consul Harry Parkes’ impudent remarks at the negotiating table, challenges him to a fist-fight, then knocks him off his feet and, with admirable ease, throws the defeated alpha male into a decorative pool. One author recollects how, after this scene, “audiences in cinemas across China burst into applause and bravos, and many broke into tears of pride and elation.”358
	But enough of that. The reason why I bring this up here is the movie’s denouement. For the last fifteen minutes or so—and do bear in mind that this was made in 1983—we are treated to an overdose of national humiliation. Emperor Xianfeng and his entourage shamefully flee, after which the Anglo–French force moves in to lay siege to the capital. Unarmed civilians, mostly women and elderly, are indiscriminately gunned down by trigger-happy Europeans rampaging through the narrow alleyways. People are rounded up and executed by the dozen, such that streets and gutters are cluttered with the dead. Violat-ed women throw themselves into wells and moats, while ‘race traitors’ supply licentious foreign troops with fresh victims. Amid the mayhem, a few intrepid commoners (who are well versed in the martial arts) offer resistance, waylaying and killing foreign troops who stray too far from the main force. However, these people’s heroes are soon overpowered, and forced to retreat. It just so happens that they hide themselves in Yuanmingyuan—this, in Li’s version of the events, provides the pretext for arson and pillage. As Harry Parkes declares to a crowd of onlookers that the foreigners will, on Lord Elgin’s orders, “burn down the world-renowned Garden of All Gardens,” a voice-over cuts in:
“Listen! The bandits intend to commit murder and arson, on the excuse that the master of the house refused to let them in. What could be more preposterous! And what nerve to shout their intentions from the rooftops! But why? Why do they act so outrageously? Be-cause China has vast land and great treasure; and what they have is ambition, rifles, and cannon! . . . This is the invaders’ so-called civilization!”359
The climactic scene of destruction follows. Foreign troops run riot, looting and setting fires, while eunuchs drown themselves in lakes. As the villas and pavilions are engulfed in a torrent of flames, the narrator’s tone veers between indignant and woeful:
“This fire! It branded shame on every Chinese face, and seared a deep hatred into every Chinese heart. It did not just burn down an imperial retreat, but awakened untold thou-sands from their ignorant slumber. The Chinese nation—a nation with the rolling waves of the Yellow and Yangtze rivers, and a billion pairs of strong hands and tearful eyes—could do nothing but watch, fists clenched, as the Garden of All Gardens was reduced to cinders.”360
Finally, the scene dissolves from the sea of fire to a view of the toppled Xiyanglou pillars in the present day. The narrator concludes:
“The ruins of Yuanmingyuan still stand on the same spot. Though they have no voice, anyone can hear them, year after year, wailing at the heavens with resentment.”361
	Li Han-hsiang’s recreation of these iconic events, with the signature vocabulary and imagery of national humiliation, conforms in every respect to post-Tiananmen historical orthodoxy. Yet it was filmed years prior, without official involvement. Indeed, national humiliation was not invented by party propagandists in the aftermath of 1989. Rather, the party associated itself with a popular aesthetic that was ‘already there.’ In other words, though the CCP changed its stripes, it did not create anything new; it just tapped into a sentiment which it previously had overlooked, or disdained, or perhaps feared. National humiliation resurfaced with such force in the 1990s only because the state’s propaganda apparatus began to promote it—a distribution infrastructure of which people like Li Han-hsiang could only dream. Content-wise, the story of China’s victimization by imperialists did not undergo any significant alteration. However, as we have seen, the CCP did add a little something to the mix: it smuggled its own political (un)truths into the narrative, masqueraded as “lessons of history.” The ‘Century’ now “undeniably proves” that the whole world is in a conspiracy against China, and that only the Communists can keep the besieged nation safe and sound. (In fact, even this is not exactly ‘new’—as was mentioned earlier, both the GMD and CCP made such messianic claims as early as the 1920s.)
	By staking its legitimacy on a history-oriented nationalism that milks the ‘Century’ for all it is worth, the CCP began telling a story that actually resonates with the popular imagi-nation. This, it would appear, saved the regime from what was considered certain death. In 1989, the CCP ordered the army to open fire on its own citizens which, it was widely anticipated, should have been the last thing the party ever did. But ten years later, Commu-nists still stood at the helm, now ‘wiping away’ one national humiliation after another with the retrocession of Hong Kong and Macau, to the applause of Chinese both at home and abroad. Another ten years later, the regime fulfilled China’s “hundred-year dream” of host-ing the Olympics, the prelude to which was a worldwide explosion of Chinese nationalis-tic fury, in response to perceived anti-China and pro-Tibet mischief. Overseas Chinese mobilized to “protect” the Olympic flame as it made its way from San Fransisco through Canberra to Seoul, while compatriots on the mainland flooded the internet with anti-Western invective, and sent death threats to foreign reporters.362 During the Paris leg of the torch relay, Tibetan hecklers tried to snatch the flame from a Chinese paralympic fencer—and in so doing, pressed the ‘Century’ button. Some days later, crowds of enraged Chinese encircled Carrefours (a French supermarket chain) across urban China: “Say no to French imperialists! Strongly protest the Anglo–French invasion of China in 1860!” ran the slo-gans.363 At least these people, it seems, had heard the voiceless lamentation of the Yuan-mingyuan ruins.
5   Conclusion
Isaiah Berlin, in an insightful 1972 Foreign Affairs article, wryly observes that nationalism “usually seems to be caused by wounds, some form of collective humiliation.”364 This may, at first, seem counterintuitive—should not the belief in the superiority of one’s own nation derive from its triumphs and glories, rather than its moments of shame? Oddly enough, as Berlin illustrates, something very much along these lines happened in eight-eenth century Germany. Dwarfed in the shadow of French hegemony, and left on the edges of the Renaissance, the Germans appeared hopelessly “provincial” compared to the rest of Europe. Such was the fear, real or not, of being sneered at by lordly neighbors, that it demanded a safety valve—and found one in self-deception. By a curious psychological somersault, the Germans came to see their unsophistication as part of their unique national essence, beautiful and desirable, thereby turning their rustic nature from something that cut them off from the world into something that elevated them above it. What is more, Berlin argues, Germany did not remain an isolated incident, but rather set a pattern that would be repeated time and again, perhaps most conspicuously in the tide of nationalism that swept through the post-colonial world in the twentieth century. Indeed, since the Germans, there have been “many a backward, exploited, or at any rate patronized society, which, resentful of the apparent inferiority of its status, reacted by turning to real or imaginary triumphs and glories in its past, or enviable attributes of its own national or cultural character.”365
	While it would be tempting to say that China is a case in point, it is not quite so. The first half of Berlin’s argument certainly applies to China; the other not so much. Collective humiliation, indeed, was the trigger of China’s national awakening in the early twentieth century. A wealth of humiliation, to be fair: botched attempts at modernization, haunting fears of racial inferiority and, above all, military defeats, economic exploitation, and diplomatic ostracism at the hands of foreign powers. But, in response, the Chinese did not dig up past triumphs and achievements (of which there would have been an abundance). To the contrary, the nation found expression precisely in the insecurities and ignominies which it was meant to counteract. What good would it be to remember glories in the distant past, when the people could not even remember the disgrace heaped on them in the immediate present? China was so terribly humiliated, it was thought, because she was sick to the marrow—and who else would administer a cure than the Chinese themselves? Only if the people were made aware, and constantly reminded of the nation’s shame, would they realize that they are sick; and only then would they remedy their own character flaws, such that the nation as a whole may regenerate.366 Thus, ‘humiliation,’ not ‘pride,’ became the rallying cry of the formative years of modern Chinese identity: only by obsessively com-memorating past disgrace could the nation be saved from future humiliation.
	This was a foundational insight that would stamp an indelible imprint on what it means to be Chinese. To this day, for all the glories of antiquity and the “5,000 years of civilization,” few things weigh as heavily on Chinese identity as the ‘Century.’ “A true Chinese,” as one author declares, “never forgets this nightmarishly terrifying, unspeakably bitter history of humiliation.”367 And there is much to remember: should “the calamity-rid-den Chinese race” commemorate every national humiliation, “there would be an average of three commemorations every day of the year.”368 (Conveniently, one humiliation for each breakfast, lunch, and dinner.) A hundred years ago, to be Chinese was to ‘never for-get’ and, if we are to take the authors’ word, it remains so today.369 The underlying ration-ale has not changed, either. The point is not just to wallow in the bitterness of past defeat and failure; rather, it is—after the example of the vengeful king Goujian of Yue370—to turn that bitterness into motivation for self-improvement, to spur people to better things. Rip-ping open old wounds has thus become the “productive condition,” to borrow Tsu Jing’s expression, of the Chinese nation.371
	Not just any wounds, however—only those inflicted from the outside. This is hardly surprising. After all, thinking back on wrongs suffered at the hands of outsiders knits the nation together in a shared sense of moral outrage. But what would come of the nation if it, with similar devotion, thought back on wrongs suffered at the hands of kin and breth-ren? For all we know, it might be torn apart from within. Small wonder, then, that the wounds inflicted on the Chinese by the Chinese themselves—far outnumbering and out-classing those inflicted by foreigners—rather than ‘never forgotten,’ are ‘never remem-bered.’
	If there is a conclusion to be drawn from this thesis, I believe, it is the above. Only by accounting for nationalist needs—moral superiority, psychological comfort, delusions of ‘togetherness’—can we make sense of how the ‘Century’ makes sense of the past. The period from 1840 to 1949 in China was extraordinarily complicated, as reality always is. China was as much at war with itself as with imperialism, and there was little to choose between Chinese and foreign violence. Looking at the situation as a whole, it is impossible to draw sharp moral distinctions. Yet the ‘Century’ closes one eye and does precisely that—tells sheep from wolves. The intricacies of reality are shoehorned into a one-dimension-al framework of benign Chinese victims versus malign foreign bullies (and their tainted ‘race-traitor’ lackeys), and whatever does not fit in is colored, trivialized, or just swept under the rug. This results in what we have called ‘selective amnesia’: the ‘Century’ re-members only violence against, never among (nor by) Chinese. And so, that extraordinar-ily complicated past is rendered into an extraordinarily simple morality tale, in which the Chinese ‘people’ are always beyond reproach, and everyone else always at fault.
	This reading is not untrue, however, in the sense that it is anchored in the factual past. Indeed, the ‘Century’ does not so much invent things that never happened, as hide from view things that did—to repeat once more, it takes a part for the whole. This is where the ‘Century,’ ‘true’ though it is, ceases to be history, and ventures into the realm of myth. It recounts real events but, by showing us only one side of the coin, deliberately misleads us to imaginary conclusions: it oversimplifies and exaggerates the impact of imperialism, the shortcomings of China’s then-rulers, the noninvolvement of the people, and so on. Essen-tially, by presenting the incomplete as complete, the ‘Century’ tries to bend the past into a shape alien to the past itself. However, the past does not always bend neatly along the contours imposed on it, putting the ‘Century’ at odds with itself in ways that are, at best, curious and, at worst, absurd. It cannot seem to decide whether misfortune was brought upon China from without or from within. Nor can it decide whether the Chinese were vic-tims or heroes. It insists that pre-PRC governments were rotten through and through, yet celebrates statesmen as people’s heroes and patriotic exemplars. It displaces everything that is evil and vile onto foreign barbarians, yet at the same time expresses an intense de-sire for China to be recognized by those barbarians, and to become more like them.
	The ‘Century’ systematically forgets parts of the past to better appeal to the nationalist palate. And whatever is likely to capture the national imagination is vulnerable to political manipulation. We devoted one chapter to examining how the CCP, at the nadir of its fortunes, began cashing in on the emotional appeal of the ‘Century.’ In so doing, the party injected its political calculus into that misremembered past, thereby distancing it even further from reality. Within the post-1989 official story of ‘the real China,’ the ‘Century’ functions as irrefutable historical evidence of a number of things that, ironically, are utterly ahistorical: that the world is by its very nature inimical to the existence of a Chinese nation, and that in such a world, CCP rule is both inevitable and indispensable. The party-state’s vision of the ‘Century’ is engineered to redirect the people’s attention from real domestic problems to imaginary foreign enemies, yet at the same time convince them that the nation’s egregious humiliations are best avenged by maintaining stability and building the economy. Tailored to fit both nationalist and political needs, the ‘Century’ is a myth to the power of two that, if swallowed whole, leads to everything but a better historical understanding—a Manichean worldview, a victimization complex, a sense of moral entitlement, a conspiracy mentality.
	We would, however, be seriously mistaken in assuming that this reading of the past is unanimously accepted. As was mentioned in passing earlier, Chinese educators often voice concern over the youth’s indifference to history. Also, living in China as a foreigner, one gets the impression that most people simply do not care about national humiliation. While many silently ignore the ‘Century,’ there are also some who actively challenge it. This key aspect—contention—unfortunately falls beyond the scope of the present study. Let us take just one example. Zhao Wenlong, in a 2003 article published in an education journal, criti-cizes national humiliation education for providing students with little more than “an outlet for venting emotions.” Whereas teaching should aim at “developing rational thinking,” he argues, China’s textbooks are brimming with false accusations against others. “Is this how we come to terms with history?” he asks rhetorically, and then answers himself with over-the-top self-loathing: “We Chinese are an unrepentant people. We always find a scapegoat to blame for our own faults.” His conclusion comes strikingly close to the original mean-ing of ‘never forgetting’: in his view, national humiliation education should rather help students to “see the Chinese people’s own weaknesses.”372 Thus, Zhao would appear to go from one extreme to the other—from blaming everyone else to blaming only the self.

In this thesis, we have attempted to describe and analyze the ‘Century of national humilia-tion.’ We should now have a fair impression of what it tells and, more importantly, what it leaves untold. In passing, we have discussed why it continues to loom over the ‘sons and grandsons of the Yellow Emperor’: it has burrowed deep into the very meaning of ‘Chi-neseness’ and, more recently, it has become part and parcel of the Communist regime’s legitimating vision. As a nationalist myth, and as a political prop, the ‘Century’ makes perfect sense. But as a history, it is deeply problematic. For it tells us more about China today, than about China in 1840–1949.
