/**
 * Very, very limited and "rogue" application of a hash table that distributes elements into buckets
 * by the hash value of their accompanying key, but then tosses the key out the window. This results
 * in some abnormal behaviour: while it is guaranteed that a stored element can be retrieved with
 * the key it is associated with, there is no guarantee that the key retrieves <em>only</em> this
 * element â€” rather, more than one element whose keys just happen to hash to the same bucket may
 * also be retrieved at the same time.
 *
 * <p>While the elements can be of any type, and {@code null} elements are permitted, specifically
 * only byte sequences (of arbitrary length) are accepted as keys.</p>
 *
 * <p>Only two methods are offered: (1) adding an element with a certain key; and (2) retrieving all
 * elements whose keys hash to the same bucket (as described above).</p>
 *
 * <p>The backing array is not dynamically resized. Hash table size must be given at instantiation,
 * and remains fixed thereafter. For this reason, this class should not be used unless the maximum
 * number of elements is definitely known in advance, so that the size can be set optimally.</p>
 *
 * <p>All things considered, due to its erratic behaviour and laughably limited functionality, this
 * class should not be used unless the caller understands exactly what they're signing up for.</p>
 *
 * <p>For hashing, the technique used in {@link String} is blatantly copied, because it gives a
 * very uniform distribution with random byte sequences. So, if table size is sensibly set, the
 * operations work in constant time.</p>
