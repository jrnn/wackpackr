/**
 * Helper class that handles the dictionary needed in LZW compression and decompression.
 *
 * <p>The dictionary works a bit differently depending whether encoding or decoding. When encoding,
 * the dictionary needs to be able to tell quickly whether it contains a certain byte sequence or
 * not, and what is its index. When decoding, the dictionary needs to be able to fetch byte
 * sequences quickly by their index. Due to these differences, different data structures are
 * employed in each case.</p>
 *
 * <p>The first case is more complex. This implementation uses a trie structure, combined with a
 * trick that treats byte sequences as "prefix indexâ€”last byte" pairs (this takes advantage of the
 * fact that when a new byte sequence is put to the dictionary, its prefix must have been put there
 * earlier and thus has an index). With this trick, during the encoding process, the existence of
 * byte sequences can be tested in near-constant time. Also, since a byte sequence of any length is
 * stored simply as a pair of values, memory overhead is cut significantly.</p>
 *
 * <p>The decoding case is much simpler. The decoder only requests byte sequences by their index,
 * and never asks for a sequence that would not have been stored prior. It should be immediately
 * obvious that a standard array handles this just fine.</p>
 *
 * <p>Beside the dictionary, this class also keeps tabs on the bit size needed in encoding and
 * decoding, because this is directly a function of the running dictionary size (that is, how many
 * bits are needed to express the "highest" index in the dictionary at any given time). The bit size
 * is checked and communicated back to the encoder/decoder after each insertion.</p>
 *
 * <p>The bit size used in encoding is capped, which sets a limit for dictionary size. Whenever the
 * dictionary is full, it must be flushed to its initial state. Because this works a bit differently
 * whether encoding or decoding, monitoring dictionary size and flushing it is delegated to the
 * encoder/decoder.</p>
