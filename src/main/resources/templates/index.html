            So what's this all about?
          </h3>
          <p>
            <strong>wackpackr</strong> accepts any kind of file, and will try compressing it with
            naive implementations of (1) <strong>Huffman</strong> and (2) <strong>LZSS</strong>
            algorithms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Immediately after this, <strong>wackpackr</strong> decompresses the compressed binary,
            just to verify whether it can be returned back to its exact initial form.
          </p>
          <p>
            The results are shown below for each algorithm.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that most files not only cannot be packed smaller, but on the contrary will take up
            even <em>MORE</em> space after compression. This is because many file types are
            compressed as-is with sophisticated techniques, so trying to squeeze them any further
            with a crappy application such as <strong>wackpackr</strong> is bound to backfire
            miserably.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to see nice compression rates, text files usually do the trick. Long,
            uncompressed text with a lot of recurring patterns can at best be packed to 20% of its
            original size.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note also that file size is capped currently at <strong>1,024 kB</strong>.
